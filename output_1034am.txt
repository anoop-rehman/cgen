{CHAPTER TWENTY
 The Sacrum and Coccyx
 From Chris and Jeremy
From Chris
The sacrum is the last section of the spine, the vestigial collection of vertebrae that are welded into one solid piece, down at the bottom. And the coccyx is the tippety-tip of the sacrum, the last bit of bone at the end of that long chain, which has been such a torment to you for so long. 
And this is the end of the book. The end of the long chain of chapters that we hope—with all our hearts—will deliver you from such torment forever. From now on, it’s up to you. Go back through the book, do the exercises, and change your behavior the way you know you should. Up to you now. 
May I say, here at the end, that putting this book together has been great fun for Jeremy and me. It has taken more than a year, and it has been a ton of work. We hope it reads as if it were easy as pie, but it wasn’t. We worked like crazy to make it seem easy—and to make it truly accurate without driving you crazy. Don’t know how well we did on that, but we sure did try. And it was fun for a couple of reasons. First, from my point of view, Jeremy is awfully good company. He is deadly serious about his profession but he loves to laugh, too. And, God bless us, we think we’re funny. That helped a lot. On a slightly more serious note, learning all the stuff I had to learn about the back this past year was fascinating and a privilege. Interesting piece of machinery, the back, and Jeremy could not have been a better guide. 
Finally, both of us are true believers in this “revolution” I mentioned up front, and that is a tremendous help. The whole time we were digging away at this boring detail or that, we had the agreeable conviction that we were not just ink-stained wretches, noses to the page. We were centurions in the great war against cruel, needless pain. That helped a lot, too. 
But the whole business won’t be satisfying to us if it doesn’t work, for you. And that takes me back to my one great worry, the one I mentioned before. 
I worry that we leave so much of this up to you, when we know that Americans just aren’t used to that. Americans are used to going to the magician/doctor. He has a look around, maybe does an MRI. And then hands us a prescription, or gives us a shot. Or sends us to his pal the back surgeon, who does some clever thing to make us all better. As we’ve said again and again, that’s not going to work here. You have to do it yourself—you have to do the exercise, make the changes. But the great question is, will you find the resolve to make it happen? Jeremy says he’s sure you will, because he knows your pain. He knows just how deep and sharp your motivation is. I hope he’s right. 
What we are urging is not really that hard; it is mostly just unfamiliar. And you surely have the resources and motivation to make it happen. I know you’re smart enough; you just read this darned book, after all. I know you are disciplined enough; you’ve been going to work all these years. And I know you care, because I know about your pain. Now just take those three things and reorient them a little. And save your life. Then spread the word and save your family, save the country. Get the ogre out of all our lives. It can and should be done. 
From Jeremy
I can’t agree more with Chris’s words. He and I had such a great time writing this book, and we are both deeply optimistic about what it can do for you. As you well know by now, I am not the “word guy”; that’s Chris. So I will be uncharacteristically brief and just say I have seen this protocol work a thousand times in my practice. Now I want to see it work a million times, perhaps more than that, with this book. As we mentioned at the beginning, we want a revolution in back care in this country. Starting with you. We want to take this scourge out of all our lives. 
JEREMY’S RULES
1
Stop doing dumb stuff.
2
Be still so you can heal.
3
Brace yourself.
4
Commit to your core.
5
Use the power in your posterior.
6
Crawl before you walk. Walk before you run.
7
Stand tall for the long haul.
APPENDIX
The “Cheat Sheet”
We threw a lot at you in this book. In time, it will seem like second nature. When you get to that point, it may still be useful to have a simple guide to remind you where you are, what to do next, and so on. To that end, I give you this “cheat sheet” to summarize all the exercises we have told you to do and to tell you when to do them. Here is your daily and weekly plan.
I strongly encourage you to read this book a few times a year. Trust me, you are trying to change lifelong habits and it’s very easy to default back to the old ways. Come back to the book and think through each exercise every so often. Avoid the trap of falling into those same bad habits that got you here in the first place. The book is the key to taking your life back and leaving the anxiety, stress, and pain of back problems in the past. In between readings of the book, there’s this Exercise Cheat Sheet. 
Basic Core Exercises
These exercises (see Chapter 10) should be done every day, and are best done in the morning after being out of bed for thirty minutes or so. Remember to do progressions or regressions as needed for each. Move on to the next progression of a particular exercise when and if you feel ready. Start with one circuit and work your way up to two full circuits in time, and make that your daily habit. In time, this will take you ten to fifteen minutes.
1. Slow March with Neutral Spine with Shoulder Flexion
2. The Bridge 
3. Crunch and Plank
4. Dynamic Hamstring Stretch
5. Side Plank
6. Cat/Camel Mobilization
7. “Bird Dog,” or Opposite Arm/Leg Extension
Glute Strengthening Routine 
Do these exercises three times a week on nonconsecutive days in addition to your core routine. Start with two sets and work your way up to three in time. This will likely add an additional ten minutes or so on those three days a week that you do these. 
1. Hip Circles Do these first!
2. Clamshell
3. Quadruped Hip Extension
4. Split Squat
5. Squat
Trigger Point Release
Do this as needed. If you got noticeable improvement in back, hip, or leg pain after mastering this, do it prior to your glute workouts until it is no longer needed. 
Stretches 
Follow up your glute routine with the following stretches from Chapter 17.
This will take three to four minutes.
1. Hamstring Stretch
2. Glute Stretch
3. Piriformis Stretch
4. Psoas Stretch

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Thanks to Jeremy, first of all, for being such a joy to work with. Coauthorship is supposed to be hard. For me—especially in this book—it has been a joy. We worked mighty hard, but we laughed a lot too.
Jeremy and I have been blessed—and we know it—to have a superb editor in a smart, kind, diplomatic, literate Bruce Tracy at Workman. (That is a shortened list of attributes; Bruce was terrific. And he really got down into the weeds as well as the big picture. As good as they get.) And, as always, thanks to the wise and kind Suzie Bolotin, editor of the Younger Next Year® books and Uber-editor of this one. Heaven!
Last, thanks to Bill Fabrocini, just about the smartest and most effective guy Jeremy and I know in the broad world of physical therapy and serious training. And about as nice a human being as I have ever met. Deep thanks, Bill.
—C. C.
I’d like to thank all of the people who have helped me become the clinician I am today. I’d like to thank Clinton Phillips, Michael Fox, Tim Powersmith, and Bill Fabrocini for their friendship, guidance, and the opportunities they have given me. Back pain has been one of the most misunderstood afflictions in modern society. Many of the concepts in this book are the result of the research and teaching of a handful of dedicated and pioneering individuals. There are many, but I would like to give special mention to Vladimir Janda, MD; David Simons, MD; Janet Travell, MD; Nikolai Bogduk, MD, PhD; and Stuart McGill, PhD. This book wouldn’t have been possible without your accomplishments. }
Read the chapter 20 of original book that I sent you and save it in your memory. Then, based on this text of chapter 20 of original book and your own information, continue the text of chapter 20 of the new book as much as you like. morover, with explaining with deep learning to me as if i were 10 years old.The text should be completely scientific and academic and based on science World Day should be written and repetition should be avoided. that are not repetitive and related to this topic. this chapter of an original book that I gave you is just a starting point and he has the right to add relevant foliage to this section. based on chapter 20 of original book, you can start

Sample 4:
Input: The question of the best approach for achieving Scottish independence continues to be a topic of debate. Some argue in favor of gradualism, taking incremental steps towards independence, while others suggest more decisive action.

One argument for gradualism is the need for Westminster's acceptance for any progress. However, the potential for the rolling back of devolution is more likely if Westminster is not on board. Supporters of this viewpoint believe that a more direct approach to independence may not be feasible at the UK level.

On the other hand, proponents of a more direct approach believe that waiting is not a viable option. They suggest a direct route to independence, involving the drafting of a Dear-John letter to the UK government. This letter would inform them of Scotland's intent to become a state on a particular date and on a clean-break basis. This approach is deemed comprehensible to normal states, whereas the UK response without a proper constitution is viewed as absurd.

Ultimately, the question of the best approach to achieving Scottish independence remains contentious. While some advocate for gradualism, others believe that a more direct approach is necessary. Whatever approach is taken, it will require a combination of political will, strategic planning, and widespread public support.

Sample 6:
Input: Imagine you are Stephen Donhoe. You were a part of this call. You are asked by your manager to summarize the discussion from the call as it pertains to Clari and it's offerings and learnings on the current way customers forecast. Ignore small talk and introductions and create a report to share with your manager.

Here is the first part transcript of the call: "
> Stephen Donohoe 08:44
Okay. Cool. Well, if you need my help at all, just let me know. And yeah, outside of that and me curse and curse one of our solution engineers here. So as I was saying to Lizzie, there definitely the brains behind the operation between the two of us. So be good to kind of dive into some of the more. Yeah tactical and detail stuff around the forecasting especially consumption today.
> 

> Curt Weaver 09:06
Absolutely nice to meet you. Hi, Nathan. Nice to meet you as well.
> 

> Nathan Seldon 09:11
How you doing. Yeah. Doing great, man. Doing great.
> 

> Curt Weaver 09:15
Excited. Use case here around your Usage product. Based in Philadelphia. I've been with Clari for about three years and typically focus on Enterprise forecasting, deployments. So we have had a couple customers come through with the consumption use case. And so Stephen tapped me to consult on what you guys are doing, so hopefully we can help you out with Larry.
> 

> Stephen Donohoe 09:41
Trust. So look, I suppose by way of an agenda for the call today, we've got another 35 minutes set aside and thought it'd best just to kind of keep this pretty conversational. I mean, we can potentially jump in and show you elements of clarity as well, if needs be. I suppose the most important thing is that we get a full understanding for how you're currently. I suppose. Forecasting and measuring, but also then hosting data around that consumption piece as well so that we can kind of go away and put together a couple of different options and see if we can find a solution that's going to work for you on that. So yeah, I suppose maybe over to you initially to just give a little bit of an overview. Maybe. Nathan, Lizzie around how you're currently reporting. On that consumption at the moment. And I'm sure Kurt will have a few questions as we go. Or unless Krista was something that you wanted to kind of kick off with.
> 

> Curt Weaver 10:32
Nothing to present, but if we could start at a high level and just understand the gotomarket approach for that product. And then how you're reporting and forecasting on that that would be very helpful.
> 

> Nathan Seldon 10:47
Yeah, no problem. I'll have a swing at them. So the product in question is called Martrus. So it's. A Payments business. You can see it more as like a fintech play. Not too dissimilar to like revolute or Monzo or you know, some of these kind of popular. He kind of more ewlowerdriven solutions that you see nowadays. So the go to market approaches like our vertical. Across all of our products is within shipping. So when we talk about that, it's like. Transportation Companies that move product by see. On Large tanker, bulk vessels. Right. And so the Martros product is aimed at the seafarers, because that's where the volume is in terms of.
> 

> Curt Weaver 11:40
Personnel.
> 

> Nathan Seldon 11:42
So here's what selling to a shipping company. Who are responsible for those seafarers onboard vessels. And really the. Kind of three main products that we would try and sell into a shipping company. One is. The Crew Payment solution. So.
> 

> Curt Weaver 12:02
Every time you pay your seatbearer, which typically once a month.
> 

> Nathan Seldon 12:07
And even any of your employees. But more typically, the seafarers is where the value proposition makes sense. We would basically charge you $12 flat on that transaction. Right. Because those seeds bearers are typically getting paid in local currency. So that's a once a month transaction. And then. And this is where it gets a little bit complex. So that's quite predictable. That's a beta B type cell, right. Every Cfare is going to get paid every month.
> 

> Curt Weaver 12:40
Pretty.
> 

> Nathan Seldon 12:41
There's then a B to B to C element because of our E wallet solution, which is once you paid those cf errors, they can also take advantage of our E wallet solution. And that helps them send money back home to their families. Right. So if the Cfarer decides to take that up. Then we typically see another $1212. Plus a small amount of fx revenue. So you could say $15 on when they paid or when they make another bank to bank transfer, which is typically like one or two. It's normally one to family back home. Right. And then you have card usage, which is like point of sale atma type transactions on that card. But that's going to be like really small fx revenue, which is tiny.
> 

> Curt Weaver 13:34
But.
> 

> Nathan Seldon 13:36
It does make up part of the like the revenue portfolio for ewallet, but again really difficult to forecast people use for it but just want to kind of paint the picture and then the other the other. Part the mantra solution is kind of like whilst we're talking to you, we could also handle your vendor payment. So when you pay vendors. It'll be a same same platform. Ultimately, what are we doing? We're making payments faster with fewer transaction fees. With a much better compliance platform kind of wrapped around it. And again, we're going to find around $15 there per transaction when they pay their customers. So the vendor payments is quite predictable. If the customer give us their volume. We know the fee that we're going to get per, you know, bank to make transfer.
> 

> Curt Weaver 14:24
The crew payments is quite predictable.
> 

> Nathan Seldon 14:27
I just need to know how many crew you got and just confirm you pay them once a month. Is really tricky because that's that B to be to C element. Like, how many times are they gonna send money back home per month. How many times are they going to do atm withdrawals? They're buy a packet cigarettes. So they're gonna go and buy like a new car. Like.
> 

> Curt Weaver 14:53
Just really difficult.
> 

> Nathan Seldon 14:54
And obviously we're making a few dollars on the fx as well every time they spend. And so, yeah, it's high. The average base that's highly, like. The challenge, as well as the ramp. So if you told me you've got 100 C fairs. Making. One payment, a month. $12 a month. That's quite easy for me to figure out what annually you're worth. Whatever. Right. But on the e wallet side. I don't know when your sea bearer is gonna choose to use it because they don't have to use it. No one can force them to use it if they don't want to. So like if you guys said, hey, we've got this amazing deal with revolution. If you use that card, you get all of these amazing perks. You might say I'm gonna stay with, like, Citibank. I'm not gonna use that. And so you're one less person that they have predicted that's just kind of dropped off, if that makes sense. But you never truly know when they're gonna drop off because there's no light optout or I want to say no. It's just like working with the accounts trying drive the doctrine. So as that ramp piece as well, which is which is which is tricky because we might say in accounts worth 100 grand and we sign them and we only find that within twelve months we found like 30 grand because we didn't get the adoption of the evolve."

Sample 8:
Input: Reputation systems are another potential revenue generation opportunity for banks operating in the metaverse. Reputation systems are a type of rating system that is used to evaluate the trustworthiness, reliability, and performance of individuals, organizations, or products. These systems are based on user-generated content, such as ratings and reviews, and can be used to help consumers make informed decisions when choosing which products or services to use.

In the metaverse, reputation systems could be used to evaluate the performance of virtual assets and digital identities. For example, a reputation system could be used to rate the performance of virtual real estate properties, digital collectibles, or even virtual currencies. A bank could use a reputation system to evaluate the performance of its digital identity verification services, or to rate the reliability of its payment processing platform.

API Development

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a set of protocols and tools that are used to build software applications. APIs allow different software systems to communicate and exchange data with one another, which can help to streamline business processes and improve operational efficiency.

In the metaverse, APIs can be used to create new applications and services that integrate with existing virtual platforms. Banks could use APIs to create new financial products and services that are tailored to the needs of metaverse users, such as virtual insurance policies, digital loans, or investment management tools.

Exchange Platforms

Exchange platforms are another potential revenue generation opportunity for banks operating in the metaverse. Exchange platforms are digital marketplaces where users can buy, sell, or trade virtual assets such as cryptocurrencies, virtual real estate, or digital collectibles.

Banks could create their own exchange platforms that are specifically designed for metaverse users. These platforms could be used to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers of virtual assets, or to provide users with access to a wide range of financial products and services.

VI.B. Exploring the Potential of Metaverse

In addition to the revenue generation opportunities discussed above, banks operating in the metaverse also have the potential to explore new technological innovations and business models. Some of the key areas that banks should focus on when exploring the potential of the metaverse include:

Decentralized Applications

Decentralized applications (DApps) are software programs that run on a decentralized network of computers. DApps are designed to be more secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship than traditional centralized applications.

In the metaverse, DApps can be used to create new types of financial products and services that are based on decentralized networks. For example, a bank could create a DApp that allows users to invest in virtual real estate properties or digital collectibles, or to lend or borrow virtual currencies.

Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. AI technology can be used to improve operational efficiency, automate processes, and enhance the customer experience.

In the metaverse, AI can be used to create personalized financial products and services that are tailored to the needs of individual users. For example, a bank could use AI to analyze a user's financial data and provide personalized investment recommendations or financial planning advice.

Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of converting real-world assets into digital tokens that can be bought, sold, and traded on a blockchain network. Tokenization can help to increase liquidity, reduce transaction costs, and make it easier to invest in a wide range of assets.

In the metaverse, tokenization can be used to create new financial products and services that are based on digital assets. For example, a bank could create a tokenized real estate investment fund that allows users to invest in virtual real estate properties, or a tokenized art investment fund that allows users to invest in digital art.

Sample 9:
Input: If you need to execute some cleanup code inside each task when a `asyncio.CancelledError` or `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised, you can catch the exception and call a cleanup function that does the necessary cleanup work.

Here's an example:
```python
import asyncio
from task1 import task1
from task2 import task2

async def cleanup():
    print("Executing cleanup code...")

async def main():
    tasks = [asyncio.create_task(task1()), asyncio.create_task(task2())]
    try:
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("Operation cancelled")
        for task in tasks:
            if not task.done():
                task.cancel()  # cancel the other tasks
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("KeyboardInterrupt received, cancelling tasks...")
        for task in tasks:
            if not task.done():
                task.cancel()  # cancel the other tasks
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    finally:
        await cleanup()

asyncio.run(main())
```
In the above example, we have added a `cleanup()` function that does the necessary cleanup work. We catch both `asyncio.CancelledError` and `KeyboardInterrupt` in separate `except` blocks, and call the `cleanup()` function in the `finally` block.

Inside each task, you can catch the `asyncio.CancelledError` exception using a `try/except` block, and call the cleanup function before re-raising the exception to propagate it to the other tasks.

Here's an example of how you can modify `task1.py` to do this:
```python
import asyncio

async def task1():
    try:
        print("Task 1 started")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        raise ValueError("Task 1 error")  # raise an error
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Task 1 error: {e}")
        await cleanup()
        tasks[1].cancel()  # cancel the other tasks
        raise asyncio.CancelledError("Task 1 cancelled") from e
```
In the above example, we catch the exception raised by the task using a `try/except` block, call the `cleanup()` function, cancel the other tasks using the `cancel()` method on the task objects, and re-raise the exception as a `asyncio.CancelledError` exception.

Note that in this example, we assume that the `cleanup()` function is defined in the same file as the `main()` function. If the function is defined in a different file, you will need to import it in the `task1.py` file.

Sample 11:
Input: To use Tailwind CSS grammar in a CSS file, you need to write the class names following a specific syntax. Here are the basic rules:

1. Class names start with a prefix that defines the category of the style, followed by a dash. For example, `bg` stands for background color, `text` for text color, and `p` for padding.
2. After the prefix, you can specify the value of the style. For example, `bg-gray-200` sets the background color to a light gray (#f3f4f6).
3. You can also use modifiers to change the style based on the context. For example, `hover:bg-gray-300` sets the background color to a slightly lighter gray (#e5e7eb) when the element is hovered.

Here are some examples to illustrate how to use Tailwind CSS grammar in a CSS file:

1. To set the background color of an element to white, you can use the `bg-white` class:
```css
.my-element {
  background-color: white;
}
```
becomes:
```css
.my-element {
  @apply bg-white;
}
```
The `@apply` directive tells PostCSS to apply the Tailwind CSS class to the element.
2. To set the font size of an element to 1.5rem, you can use the `text-lg` class:
```css
.my-element {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```
becomes:
```css
.my-element {
  @apply text-lg;
}
```
3. To set the padding of an element to 1rem on all sides, you can use the `p-4` class:
```css
.my-element {
  padding: 1rem;
}
```
becomes:
```css
.my-element {
  @apply p-4;
}
```
4. To set the background color of an element to a light gray when it is hovered, you can use the `hover:bg-gray-200` class:
```css
.my-element:hover {
  background-color: #f3f4f6;
}
```
becomes:
```css
.my-element {
  @apply hover:bg-gray-200;
}
```

Overall, using the Tailwind CSS grammar in a CSS file allows you to write more concise and maintainable code, as you can rely on a pre-defined set of classes to style your elements.

Sample 12:
Input: The `get_users_in_group` function in the code above is not strictly RESTful, as it does not adhere to the principle of using a resource-oriented URL structure. Instead of using a URL like `/groups/{group_id}/users`, a more RESTful design might be to use a URL like `/users`, with the `group_id` parameter being optional. This would allow clients to fetch all users (regardless of group), or to filter users by group.

Here's an updated implementation of the `get_users_in_group` function that supports this more RESTful design:
```python
@app.get("/users")
async def get_users(group_id: Optional[int] = None):
    async with SessionLocal() as session:
        if group_id is not None:
            group = session.query(Group).filter(Group.id == group_id).first()
            if group is None:
                return {"detail": "Group not found"}
            users = group.users
        else:
            users = session.query(User).all()

        return users
```
In this implementation, the function is renamed to `get_users`, and the `group_id` parameter is made optional. If `group_id` is specified, the function filters the list of users to only include those in the specified group. If `group_id` is not specified, the function returns all users. This implementation supports a more resource-oriented URL structure, such as `/users` for all users or `/users?group_id=1` to get users in group with ID 1.

Sample 15:
Input: Abstract. A research programme designed to find ways of applying a variety of
methods in psychological science to studying the seemingly ephemeral phenomena
of the human stream of consciousness and its manifestations in daydreams, interior
monologues, imagery and related private experiences is described. Approaches
include psychometric studies to establish normative information on daydreaming
and experimental studies using signal-detection paradigms to capture the ongoing
stream of thought. Recent experiments involve thought-sampling methods for
identifying the determinants of the content of the stream of thought in adolescents
or the ways in which self-beliefs and emotions are manifested in a group of cocaine
and heroin abusers. Children’s pretend play is studied as a possible forerunner
of adult consciousness. It is proposed that the human condition involves a
continuing tension between processing information generated from the physical
and social milieu and the continuous operation of centrally generated material
from long-term memory in the form of reminiscences, wishes, current concerns,
expectancies and fantasies. This concept has implications for personality variation,
affective arousal and adaptive behaviour.

William James’ (1890) introduction of the concept of a stream of consciousness,
so stimulating to several generations of writers, from his own student Gertrude
Stein to James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner and Saul Bellow, was
largely ignored by psychologists for almost 60 years of the 20th century. More
recently, however, as personality researchers and specialists in social cognition
attempt to examine the major characteristics of the individual that account for
beliefs about self or others and for attitudes that may govern overt behaviour,
they find increasing renewed interest in introspection and reports of
consciousness (Sabini & Silver 1981, Singer & Kolligian 1987). Brain researchers,
students of artificial intelligence, psychophysiologists and investigators of the
neural and autonomic concomitants of sleep are intrigued by the opportunity
for studying personal ‘scripts’, ongoing images, fantasies and interior

Schank & Abelson 1977, Singer & Bonanno 1990, Sperry 1976).
Although one must always keep in mind the limitations of using introspective
reports for ascertaining causality sequences, the analyses of Natsoulas (1984),
Baars (1987) and Singer & Bonanno (1990) all point to the rich range of
information about beliefs and attitudes that emerges from introspective accounts,
even from relatively less articulate subjects (Hurlburt 1990, Pekala 1991, Pope
1978).
In this paper, I shall focus on the study of ongoing consciousness through
a variety of methods and experimental procedures. I propose we need such a
basis for understanding at least one phase of the human condition, our ‘private
personality’. Experiences of interior monologue, mental glosses on one’s social
and physical surround, daydreams, fantasies, anticipations, recurring memories,
all of which may interrupt or co-occur with our necessary processing of
information, form a consensually agreed upon or physically measurable ‘external
world’. My personal strategy for ‘navigating’ the stream of consciousness over
forty years of research has involved sets of convergent empirical methods with
the hope that groups of new operations can yield reliable methods of
measurement. These may lead to identification of the relevant phenomena and
perhaps to formulation of theories and testable hypotheses about the
determinants of ongoing sequences of thought and their implications for
emotional reactions, information processing, the formation of interpersonal
attitudes, beliefs about self and possibly even the roots of creativity, on the
one hand, or to linkages to physical and mental health, on the other.
Psychometric approaches to the study of daydreams and ongoing consciousness
Rorschach inkblots
As a clinical psychologist, I began my effort to study imagination, daydreams
and consciousness through some of the first empirical studies of correlates of
responses to the Rorschach inkblots. Hermann Rorschach (1942) had proposed
that persons who were inclined to ‘see’ human figures as associations to the
blots, especially associations involving humans in action, were also more likely
to show a rich fantasy life and engage in much daydreaming. Rorschach also
reported that the persons who provided more of such human movement
responses (the so-called M score) were more susceptible to inhibition in their
movements or were more capable of controlling physical activity or behavioural
motion. Research attention has focused chiefly upon linking the M response
frequency to measures of fantasy, motor control, creativity, self-awareness and
‘planfulness’ (Moise et a1 1988-1989, Singer & Brown 1977). Dozens of
individual difference and factor-analytic studies consistently show that persons
who give more M associations to inkblots (especially responses that are
102 Singer
reasonably congruent with the blot shapes) are also more likely to tell rich and
varied stories in response to thematic apperception test pictures, to score more
highly on questionnaire measures of daydreaming frequency, and to provide
more varied and cognitively complex free associations and person descriptions
in other tests and in psychoanalytic sessions. They are also more likely to sit
quietly in waiting rooms, to be able to slow down writing speed voluntarily,
to resist laughing if so instructed when listening to a ‘laughing’ record, to show
fewer impulsive responses in problem-solving tasks, to be more accurate in time
estimates and to manifest less open aggression (Singer & Brown 1977). Clinically,
percipients with a low M score respond better to support-expressive or direct
therapies, whereas those scoring a higher M value do better in more
psychoanalytic types of therapy where imaginative productivity and free
associations are critical (Blatt 1990).
Questionnaires and self report procedures
It soon occurred to me that more direct inquiries about people’s daydreams
and ongoing thought might provide useful normative data on the phenomena
of private experience. Singer & Antrobus (1972) developed a series of 22 scales
of 12 items, each designed to measure a wide range of patterns of self-reported
inner experience and types of daydreams. This imaginal processes inventory (IPI)
has been factor-analysed in several studies with subjects of all ages. An extensive
new analysis of the IPI with a large sample of college students has led to a
shortened version, the SIP1 (Huba et a1 1982, Segal et a1 1980). From the varied
uses of‘ the IPI, some generalizations about the normative role of daydreams
are possible.
Briefly, many studies indicate that most people report being aware of at least
some daydreaming every day, and that their daydreams vary from obvious
wishful thinking to elaborate and complex visions of frightening or guilty
encounters. Cultural differences in frequency and patterning of daydreaming
also emerge. Comprehensive factor analysis of the scales of the IPI indicates
that the data yield three major factors that characterize ongoing thought: a
positive-constructive daydreaming style, a guilty-dysphoric daydreaming style,
and a poor attentional control pattern that is generally characterized by fleeting
thoughts and an inability to focus on extended fantasy (Singer & Kolligian 1987,
Singer & Bonanno 1990). Giambra (1977a,b) found evidence for factor patterns
similar to those reported in our studies and tracked these across an extensive
age range; in addition, he checked the test-retest reliability of daydreaming
reports in response to this set of scales and found it to be surprisingly high.
Even with reliable and psychometrically well-constructed questionnaires, we
are still left with the issue of whether individual respondents can really summarize
accurately their ongoing experiences, the frequency of particular daydreams,
etc. We must turn to other estimates of ongoing thought or other forms of
Ongoing conscious experience 103
self-report to ascertain the validity of the questionnaire responses. Reviewing
such data, one finds that the self-reports of frequent or vivid daydreaming on
questionnaires are correlated with:
(1) daydream-like thoughts obtained during signal-detection tasks, with
imagery so vivid that the participants don’t notice that a faint picture
has been projected at the point they are fixating while imagining an object;
(2) with particular patterns of eye shifts during reflective thought;
(3) with particular emphasis on analogy usage when the structure of the
language used in transcripts of regularly sampled thought reports is
analysed;
(4) with particular forms of drug and alcohol use;
(5) with reported fantasies during sexual behaviour;
(6) with daily records of dreams recalled;
(7) with measures of hypnotic susceptibility;
(8) with measures of hallucinations of mental patients or flashbacks of
The evidence from our own and related questionnaires suggests that the
psychometric approach has considerable value in identifying individual stylistic
variations in awareness of, and assignment of priorities to, processing centrally
generated information.
traumatized war veterans, etc (Singer & Bonanno 1990).
More direct thought-sampling procedures
Laboratory studies of signal detection
My colleague John Antrobus and I developed a particular paradigm for
attempting to estimate some parameters of ongoing thought. An approach that
affords maximum ‘control’ over extraneous stimulation (at the cost of some
artificiality or possibly reduced ‘ecological validity’) is the use of prolonged
(45-60 minute) signal-detection sessions by participants seated in sound-proof,
reduced-stimulation booths. Because the amount of external stimulation can
be controlled, it remains to be determined to what extent individuals will shift
their attention away from processing external cues (by which they earn money
for accurate signal detection) toward the processing of material that is generated
by the presumably ongoing activity of their own brains. Can we ascertain the
conditions under which participants, even with high motivation for external
signal processing, will show that they are experiencing task-unrelated images
and thoughts (TUITs)?
Thus, if an individual detecting auditory signals is interrupted every 15 seconds
and questioned about whether any stimulus-independent thoughts occurred, a
‘Yes’ response is scored as a TUIT. The participant and experimenter agree in
advance on a common definition of what constitutes a task-unrelated thought,
so that the experimenter has some reasonable assurance that reports conform
104 Singer
to an established operational definition. A thought such as ‘Is that tone more
highly-pitched than the one before it?’ is considered task-related and elicits a
‘No’ response. A thought such as ‘I’ve got to pick up the car keys for my
Saturday night date’ is scored as a TUIT.
In this research paradigm, keeping the subjects in booths for a fairly long
time and obtaining reports of the occurrence of task-unrelated thoughts after
each 15 seconds of signal detection (with tones presented at rates of about one
per second) have made it possible to accumulate extensive information on the
frequency of occurrence of TUITs, as well as their relationship to the speed
of signal presentation, the complexity of the task and other characteristics of
the subjects’ psychological states.
In addition to generalizations about the nature of cognitive processing (Singer
1988), the signal-detection model permits the study of individual differences.
Antrobus et al (1967) showed that participants known by self-report to be
frequent daydreamers were more likely as time went on to report TUITs than
individuals who had said on a questionnaire that they were little given to
daydreaming. Initially, the frequent daydreamers reported a considerable
number of TUITs, but the same level of errors as the infrequent daydreamers.
As time went on, however, the frequent daydreamers seemed to be preferring
to respond to task-unrelated mentation: their error rate increased significantly,
compared with the relatively stable rate of errors for the subjects who showed
fewer TUITs.
Controlled studies of ongoing thought during signal detection afford a rich
opportunity for investigating the determinants of the thought stream. The
introduction of unusual or alarming information prior to entry into the detection
booth (overhearing a broadcast of war news) can increase the frequency of
TUITs, even though accuracy of detection may not be greatly affected (Antrobus
et a1 1966). Mardi Horowitz (1978) has demonstrated that intense emotional
experiences prior to engaging in signal detection lead to increased ideation, as
measured by thought sampling during the detection period. Such findings have
suggested a basis for understanding clinical phenomena such as ‘unbidden
images’ (Horowitz 1978) or ‘peremptory ideation’.
Studies using auditory and visual signal detection or vigilance models with
interruptions for reports have also shown that TUITs occur more than half of
the time, even when subjects are achieving very high detection rates, when signals
come as frequently as every 0.5 seconds or when the density (i.e. chords versus
single tones) of signal information is increased. Indeed, there was evidence for
parallel processing of the TUITs and the external signals. When external signals
were visual, the visual content of TUITs was reduced relative to their verbal
content and vice versa when the external signals were auditory. This suggests
that our daydream processes in particular sensory imagery modalities (visual
or auditory) use the same brain pathways as are needed for processing external
cues. Studies of continuous talk in these laboratory settings point to the
Ongoing conscious experience 105
moderately arousing, vigilance-maintaining quality of ongoing thought and also
to the dependence of such thought on physical posture, the social setting, etc.
For example, when experimenters and participants are of the opposite sex there
is a significant increase in TUIT reports during signal detections (Singer 1988,
Singer & Bonanno 1990).
Thought sampling in more ‘natural’ circumstances
Some methods that sacrifice the rigid controls of the signal-detection booth for
greater ecological relevance have been increasingly employed in the development
of an approach to determining the characteristics and determinants of waking
conscious thought. These involve (1) asking participants to talk out loud while
in a controlled environment, with such verbalization being scored according
to empirically or theoretically derived categories; (2) allowing the respondent
to sit, recline, or stand quietly and interrupting them periodically for reports
of thought or perceptual activity; or (3) requiring the person to signal by a button
press whenever a new chain of thought begins, and then to report verbally in
retrospect or to fill out a prepared rating form characterizing various possible
features of ongoing thought.

Sample 16:
Input: Oh, I see. So, you're talking about a metric that evaluates how well each reviewer's ratings correlate with the final scores of the posts they review. In that case, you could use a correlation coefficient, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient, to calculate the degree of correlation between each reviewer's ratings and the final post scores.

For example, let's say you have a dataset of post scores and three reviewers (A, B, and C), each of whom gives ratings on a scale of 0 to 4. You could calculate the correlation coefficient between each reviewer's ratings and the final post scores, and use that as a metric of the quality of their reviews.

To do this, you would first calculate the mean RMS score for each post based on the ratings of all three reviewers. Then, for each reviewer, you would calculate the correlation coefficient between their ratings and the mean RMS scores of the posts they reviewed. The correlation coefficient would tell you how well their ratings correlate with the final scores, with values ranging from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation).

You could then use these correlation coefficients as a metric of the quality of each reviewer's reviews. Reviewers with higher correlation coefficients would be considered to provide higher quality reviews, as their ratings better predict the final scores of the posts they review.

Sample 17:
Input: As Jack entered the museum, he took a deep breath, inhaling the familiar scent of old wood and linoleum. It was one of the few places that he felt truly at peace, even after the tragic loss of his father. Jack's mother worked here, and it was a place where he could spend his free time after school, wandering through the exhibits and the halls, feeling the weight of the world lift off his shoulders.

As he made his way towards his mother's office, he exchanged brief greetings with other museum employees who knew him, but he kept to himself for the most part. Jack was a quiet, reserved kid, and his father's death had only amplified those tendencies.

When he arrived at his mother's office, he found her engrossed in paperwork, barely looking up as he entered. "Hey, Mom," he said softly.

She smiled, "Hey, Jack. How was school?"

"It was fine," he replied, "I'm going to wander around the museum for a bit. Do you need anything?"

"No, I'm good. Just be back by six," she said, returning her attention to the papers on her desk.

Jack nodded and made his way into the exhibit halls, where he was greeted by the familiar sights and sounds of the museum. As he made his way through the halls, he noticed a small crowd gathering around a particular exhibit. Curiosity got the better of him, and he made his way over to see what was causing the commotion.

There, in the center of the group, was a mirror. It was an ornate, gilded thing, and the way it caught the light made it seem almost otherworldly. Jack couldn't take his eyes off it, and before he knew it, he was standing directly in front of it.

For what felt like hours, he stared into the mirror, lost in thought. It was as if he was hypnotized, and he couldn't look away. The longer he stared, the more he felt himself being pulled into the mirror, like he was being sucked into another world.

Suddenly, a hand was on his shoulder, and Jack jumped, startled out of his trance. It was one of the museum employees, a friendly woman who had seen him staring into the mirror for what felt like an eternity.

"Hey there, kiddo," she said, "I see you've discovered the mirror. It's a pretty fascinating thing, isn't it?"

Jack nodded, not really sure what to say.

"Believe it or not, some people think it's a portal to another dimension," she said with a chuckle.

Jack raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

"Of course, we don't know for sure," she added quickly, "but it's definitely got a certain allure to it. You know, some people have claimed to see their future selves in that mirror."

Jack's interest was piqued, and he found himself drawn back to the mirror, eager to see what secrets it held.

Sample 18:
Input: MK's heart was pounding in his chest as he was dragged along by Wukong. He had long since given up on trying to escape or fight back - he knew it was pointless against Wukong's strength and powers. He glanced at the Monkey King, who was scowling with determination.

Suddenly, Wukong stopped and looked up at the sky, deep in thought. MK followed his gaze and saw the majestic gates of Heaven in the distance, guarded by divine beings. He felt a wave of dread wash over him - he knew Wukong was powerful, but even he couldn't defy the gods.

"Wukong, we can't go there," MK said in a low voice, hoping to reason with him. "The gods will stop us, and we'll never make it out alive."

But Wukong just gave him a cold, hard stare. "I am the Great Sage Equal to Heaven," he said. "I fear no god or deity. We will get that diamond snare, even if we have to tear Heaven apart to do it."

MK felt a shiver run down his spine. He had heard of Wukong's arrogance and his tendency to overestimate his own power, but he had never seen it so clearly before. He had never felt so small and powerless in his life.

As they approached the gates of Heaven, MK closed his eyes and tried to brace himself for what was to come. He didn't know what Wukong was planning, but he knew it was going to be bad - for them, for Heaven, for everyone. All he could do was hope that somehow, someway, they would be stopped before it was too late.
