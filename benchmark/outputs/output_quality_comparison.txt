SEESAW SAMPLES:
===============
Sample 1:
Input: the segmentation process as a whole can be thought of as consisting of two tasks : recognition and delineation . 
 recognition is to determine roughly `` where '' the object is and to distinguish it from other object - like entities . 
--
Sample 2:
Input: studies of charm decays are pursued for several different reasons . 
 first of all , there is the possibility of directly observing new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , since the effects of cp violation due to sm processes is highly suppressed allowing new physics contributions to be more easily seen than in @xmath8 decays where the sm processes typically have large effects @xcite . @xmath1 
--
Sample 3:
Input: for fixed integers @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we consider the admissible sequences of @xmath2 lattice paths in a colored @xmath3 square given in @xcite . each admissible sequence of paths can be associated with a partition @xmath10 of @xmath4 . in section 
 [ paths ] , we show that the number of self - conjugate admissible sequences of paths associated with @xmath10 is equal to the number of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath10 , and thus can be calculated using the hook length formula . 
--
Sample 4:
Input: a magnitude limited complete census of variable stars in nearby dwarf galaxies allows important contributions to the star formation history of these systems . measurements of some variable stars can supply improved distance determinations for the host galaxies , others will provide important constraints for the population analysis . 
 different classes of variables can further improve the understanding of the star formation history of these system , functioning as tracers of star formation during different epochs . 
--
Sample 5:
Input: there are reasons to believe that cosmic rays ( crs ) around the ankle at @xmath0 gev are dominated by extragalactic protons  @xcite . 
 scattering processes in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) limit the propagation of ultra high energy ( uhe ) charged particles in our universe . 
--
Sample 6:
Input: in solid - core photonic crystal fibers ( pcf ) the air - silica microstructured cladding ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) gives rise to a variety of novel phenomena  @xcite including large - mode area ( lma ) endlessly - single mode operation @xcite . 
 though pcfs typically have optical properties very different from that of standard fibers they of course share some of the overall properties such as the susceptibility of the attenuation to macro - bending . 
--
Sample 7:
Input: a fair number of astronomers and astronomy students have a physical challenge . 
 it is our responsibility to learn the basics of accessibility to be able to help our library patrons to gain access to things that they need for their studies and work . 
--
Sample 8:
Input: in adaptive control and recursive parameter estimation one often needs to adjust recursively an estimate @xmath0 of a vector @xmath1 , which comprises @xmath2 constant but unknown parameters , using measurements of a quantity @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a vector of known data , often called the regressor , and @xmath5 is a measurement error signal .
