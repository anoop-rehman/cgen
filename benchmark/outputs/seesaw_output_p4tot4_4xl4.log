Sample 2:
Input: studies of charm decays are pursued for several different reasons . 
 first of all , there is the possibility of directly observing new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , since the effects of cp violation due to sm processes is highly suppressed allowing new physics contributions to be more easily seen than in @xmath8 decays where the sm processes typically have large effects @xcite . @xmath1 
 mixing also is interesting because it could come from either sm or new physics ( np ) processes , and could teach us interesting lessons . 
 another important reason for detailed charm studies is that most @xmath8 s , @xmath999% , decay into charm , so knowledge about charm decays is particularly useful for @xmath8 decay studies . 
 especially interesting are absolute branching ratios , resonant substructures in multi - body decays , phases on dalitz plots , etc .. other heavier objects such as top quarks decay into @xmath8 quarks and higgs particles may decay with large rates to @xmath10 , again making charm studies important . 
 furthermore , charm can teach us a great deal about strong interactions , especially decay constants and final state interactions . 
 charm has been studied at @xmath11 colliders at threshold , first by the mark iii collaboration and more recently by bes and cleo - c , at higher @xmath11 energies , and at fixed target and hadron collider experiments @xcite . 
 the detection techniques are rather different at threshold than in other experiments . 
 the @xmath12 resonance decays into @xmath13 ; the world average cross - section is 3.72@xmath140.09 nb for @xmath15 production and 2.82@xmath140.09 nb for @xmath16 production @xcite . 
 @xmath5 production is studied at 4170 mev , where the cross - section for @xmath17+@xmath18 is @xmath91 nb @xcite . the underlying light quark 
 continuum " background is about 14 nb . 
 the relatively large cross - sections , relatively large branching ratios and sufficient luminosities , allow experiments to fully reconstruct one @xmath19 as a  tag . " 
 since the charge and flavor of the tag is then uniquely determined , the rest of the event can be examined for characteristics of the other  known " particle . to measure absolute branching ratios , for example at the @xmath12 , the rest of the event is fully reconstructed , as well as the tag .    at the @xmath12 @xmath19 meson final states are reconstructed by first evaluating the difference in the energy , @xmath20 , of the decay products with the beam energy . candidates with @xmath20 consistent with zero are selected and then the @xmath19 beam - constrained mass is evaluated , @xmath21 where @xmath22 runs over all the final state particles . 
 examples of single and double reconstruction are presented in fig . 
 [ cleo - double](a ) that shows the @xmath23 distribution for a @xmath24 or @xmath25 final states . 
 these  single tags " show a large signal and a very small background . 
 [ cleo - double](b ) shows a  double " tag sample where both @xmath3 and @xmath26 candidates in the same event are reconstructed . 
 distributions for candidates from either @xmath24 or @xmath25 modes . 
 ( b ) the @xmath27 distribution for candidates for candidates from @xmath24 and @xmath25 modes . 
 the solid curves are a fits to the signals plus the backgrounds , that are indicated by the dashed shapes . 
 the signals are asymmetric due to radiation of the electron beams.,title="fig:",width=302 ]   distributions for candidates from either @xmath24 or @xmath25 modes . 
 ( b ) the @xmath27 distribution for candidates for candidates from @xmath24 and @xmath25 modes . 
 the solid curves are a fits to the signals plus the backgrounds , that are indicated by the dashed shapes . 
 the signals are asymmetric due to radiation of the electron beams.,title="fig:",width=294 ]    other experiments make use of the both the approximately picosecond lifetimes of charm to identify detached vertices , and the decay @xmath28 , which also serves as a flavor tag in the case of @xmath29 transitions . 
 in charm meson decays , usually a single branching ratio sets the scale for determinations of most other rates , that are measured relative to it . for @xmath2 and @xmath3 
 these modes are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . 
 cleo - c , on the other hand uses a different technique where the branching ratios of several modes are determined simultaneously and all absolutely . 
 consider an ensemble of modes @xmath22 , that are both singly reconstructed and also doubly reconstructed , where all combinations of modes may be used . 
 i denote the number of observed single tag charmed particles as @xmath32 , anti - charmed particles as @xmath33 , and double tags as @xmath34 . 
 they are related to the number of @xmath13 events ( either charged or neutral ) through their branching ratios @xmath35 as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the reconstruction efficiencies in single and double tag events for each mode . 
 ( in practice the differences in each mode between single and double tag events are small , and @xmath39 . ) solving these equations we find @xmath40    cleo - c has recently updated their absolute branching ratio measurements using a 281 pb@xmath41 data sample , an approximately 5 times larger data sample than used by them for their previous publication @xcite . 
 the new preliminary results are shown in table  [ tab : dbr ] @xcite . 
 ( in this table when two errors follow a number , the first error is statistical and the second systematic ; this will be true for all results quoted in this paper unless specifically indicated . ) 
 the absolute branching fractions for charm mesons have been measured with unprecedented accuracy . 
 combining the pdg values with the preliminary cleo - c results for @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays , and using the cleo - c results for @xmath5 , i find @xmath42    cleo - c does not quote a branching ratio for @xmath43 mode because of interferences on the dalitz plot . 
 the @xmath44 or the @xmath45 modes should be used for normalization . 
 since most of the @xmath46 decay modes have been measured as ratios to the @xmath47 mode , i extract an effective branching ratio @xmath48    these rates can be used for many purposes . for example , adding up the number of charm quarks produced in each @xmath49 meson decay at the @xmath50 resonance by summing the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , charmed baryon and twice the charmonium yields gives a rate of 1.09@xmath140.04 , where the largest error comes from the @xmath2 yield . 
 there is no definitive evidence for @xmath52 mixing . 
 the best limits yet are @xmath53% and @xmath54 both at 95% c. l. the limit on @xmath55 of about 8% is just beginning to probe an interesting range . 
 there are two hints that mixing may be soon found . 
 belle finds consistency with no mixing at 3.9% c. l. in wrong - sign @xmath30 decays and babar finds consistency with no mixing at 4.5% c. l. in wrong sign @xmath56 decays , thus making further searches more interesting . 
 there have not been any observations of cp or t violation .

 as usual it takes two interfering amplitudes to generate an asymmetry , so no direct sm cp asymmetries can arise in pure cabibbo allowed or doubly - cabibbo suppressed decays .

Sample 3:
Input: for fixed integers @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we consider the admissible sequences of @xmath2 lattice paths in a colored @xmath3 square given in @xcite . each admissible sequence of paths can be associated with a partition @xmath10 of @xmath4 . in section 
 [ paths ] , we show that the number of self - conjugate admissible sequences of paths associated with @xmath10 is equal to the number of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath10 , and thus can be calculated using the hook length formula . 
 we extend this result to include the non - self - conjugate admissible sequences of paths and show that the number of all such admissible sequences of paths is equal to the sum of squares of the number of standard young tableaux of partitions of @xmath4 with height less than or equal to @xmath11 . using the rsk correspondence in @xcite , 
 it is shown in ( @xcite , corollary 7.23.12 ) that the sum of squares of the number of standard young tableaux of partitions of @xmath4 with height less than or equal to @xmath11 is equal to the number of @xmath6-avoiding permutations of @xmath7 .    in section [ multiplicities ] 
 , we apply our results to the representation theory of the affine kac - moody algebra @xmath8 . 
 let @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the simple roots , simple coroots , and fundamental weights respectively . 
 note that @xmath15 
 . for @xmath16 , set @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as shown in @xcite , @xmath19 
 are maximal dominant weights of the irreducible @xmath8-module @xmath9 . 
 we show that the multiplicity of the weight @xmath19 in @xmath9 is the number of @xmath6-avoiding permutations of @xmath7 , which proves conjecture 4.13 in @xcite . 
 for fixed integers @xmath0 and @xmath1 , consider the @xmath3 square containing @xmath20 unit boxes in the fourth quadrant so that the top left corner of the square is at the origin . 
 we assign color @xmath21 to a box if its upper left corner has coordinates @xmath22 . 
 this gives the following @xmath3 colored square @xmath23 :      a lattice path @xmath25 on @xmath23 is a path joining the lower left corner @xmath26 to the upper right corner @xmath27 moving unit lengths up or right . for two lattice paths @xmath28 on @xmath23 
 we say that @xmath29 if the boxes above @xmath30 are also above @xmath25 . 
 now , we draw @xmath2 lattice paths , @xmath31 on @xmath23 such that @xmath32 . for integers 
 @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , we define @xmath36 to be the number of @xmath37-colored boxes between @xmath38 and @xmath39 . 
 we define @xmath40 to be the number of @xmath37-colored boxes below @xmath41 and @xmath42 to be the number of @xmath37-colored boxes above @xmath43 . 
 denote by @xmath49 the set of all admissible sequences of @xmath2 paths . 
 notice that there are @xmath4 0-colored boxes in @xmath23 and hence for any admissible sequence of paths , @xmath50 . 
 in addition , it follows from definition [ pathsdef](2 ) that @xmath51 for any admissible sequence of paths . 
 thus , we can and do associate an admissible sequence of paths @xmath44 on @xmath23 with a partition @xmath52 of @xmath4 . in this case , we say that this admissible sequence of paths is of type @xmath10 and often draw @xmath10 as a young diagram . 
 figure [ adseq](a ) is an element of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are shown in figures [ adseq](b ) , [ adseq](c ) , and [ adseq](d ) , respectively .

Sample 4:
Input: a magnitude limited complete census of variable stars in nearby dwarf galaxies allows important contributions to the star formation history of these systems . measurements of some variable stars can supply improved distance determinations for the host galaxies , others will provide important constraints for the population analysis . 
 different classes of variables can further improve the understanding of the star formation history of these system , functioning as tracers of star formation during different epochs . 
 we expect the data set of our long term monitoring program to be especially well suited to study the contents of red long - period variables and to re - investigate the paucity of cepheids with @xmath1 days as reported by sandage & carlson ( 1985 ) . 
 we selected a sample of six local group dwarf irregular galaxies which are visible with the 0.8  m telescope of our institute at mt . 
 the names and additional data from the literature compilation by mateo ( 1998 ) are shown in table 1 . 
 .names , variable star counts , absolute @xmath2-band brightness in mag , and current distance estimation in kpc for the dwarf galaxies observed in our project . 
 the data are taken from the literature compilation by mateo ( 1995 ) . 
 for leo a the data are from the work of dolphin et . 
 al ( 2002 ) and from this work . [ cols="<,<,^,^,^,^,^ " , ]     @xmath3 this work    the observations so far were carried out in @xmath4 and @xmath2-band , sparsely sampling a three year period starting with test observations in 1999 . 
 this part of the data set should be sensitive for long period variable stars with periods up to @xmath5 days . 
 additional observations in @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath6-band were obtained during 3 observing campaigns at the 1.23  m telescope on calar alto densely sampling three two week long periods . 
 these observations should provide a ground for a search for variable stars with shorter periods ranging from @xmath7 days up to @xmath8 days . 
 the acquired data were bias subtracted , flat - fielded and cosmic ray rejected . 
 then , the images from one night were astrometrically aligned to a common reference frame and combined with individual weights proportional to their @xmath9 . for each epoch , consisting of all the stacked images of a single night , a difference image against a common deep reference frame was created using an implementation ( gssl & riffeser , 2002 , 2003 ) of the alard algorithm ( alard & lupton , 1998 ) . 
 finally , these difference images were convolved with a stellar psf .    to extract lightcurves from the reduced data , 
 first all pixels deviating significantly ( @xmath10 ) from the reference image in a minimum number of epochs @xmath11 were flagged , utilizing the complete per - pixel error propagation of our data reduction pipeline . 
 then , using these coordinates as input , values and associated errors are read from the difference images and the lightcurve data are assembled . to search for periodic signals in the extracted difference fluxes , a lomb ( 1976 ) algorithm using the interpretation from scargle ( 1982 ) 
 is applied . 
 the photometric calibration was conducted using the hst data published by schulte - ladbeck et al . 
 for the galaxies leo  a , and ugca  92 , we have a very good monitoring and a large fraction of the data passed already the pipeline . 
 the leo  a data set serves as test case : a total of 26 variable star candidates were detected . among them 
 , we identified 16 secure long period variables ( typical average values @xmath12 , and @xmath13 period [ days ] @xmath14 ) , and we have 8 further candidates for lpvs . 
 in addition we were able to identify two good candidates for @xmath0 cephei stars with best fitting periods of 6.4 and 1.69 days . 
 the later candidate was previously described by dolphin et al . 
 ( 2002 ) as c2-v58 with a period of 1.4 days . the dolphin et al . 
 period solution fails in deriving a reliable lightcurve with our data , yet , applying our period value to their data set yields reasonable results . 
 the phase convolved lightcurves for the two @xmath0 cephei variables are shown in figure  1 . 
 the color magnitude diagram shown in the left panel of figure  2 is based upon the hst data published by tolstoy et al . 
 ( 1996 ) and schulte - ladbeck et al . flagged by bigger symbols 
 are those variables from our sample that lie inside the hst field of view , two @xmath0 cephei variables in the instability strip ( crosses ) and the candidates for long term variability ( triangles ) in the regime of the red giants . 
 tolstoy et al . 
 ( 1996 ) based on ground - based data found a distance modulus for leo  a of 24.2 and a resulting distance of 690 kpc ( see also schulte - ladbeck et al . ) . 
 this result got further support by the search for short periodic variables with the wiyn telescope within 3 consecutive days in dec . 2000 ( dolphin et al . 
 our data complement this dataset for longer periods . 
 the right hand panel of figure  2 shows the period - luminosity ( pl ) relation of the smc shifted to the distance determined by tolstoy et al . 
 the short period variables measured by dolphin coincide with the shown pl relation . 
 the overplotted values for the two cepheids from our survey ( crosses ) support this relation also in the regime of longer periods . 
 we presented preliminary results for our survey for variable stars in a sample of irregular local group dwarf galaxies . for the leo  a dwarf galaxy , the best analysed case so far 
 , we already identified a total of 26 candidates for variability , 16 of these as long period variables and 2 @xmath0 cephei stars . 
 we compared the later with the period - luminosity relation and the short period variables discussed by dolphin et al . 
 we found , that our cepheids fully support their findings and the resulting distance estimate for leo  a. this result is further in good agreement with the trgb distance ( tolstoy et al . 
 , schulte - ladbeck et al . ) . 
 the location of the lpvs in the color - magnitude diagram indicate that most of them are early asymptotic giant branch stars . 
 while a complete census of these intermediate age stars is missing for most of the local group members , a proper statistic of their appearance can guide the reconstruction of the star formation history at the age of several gyr by - passing the age metalicity degeneracy inherent to color magnitude diagram studies .

Sample 5:
Input: in quantum information processing , information is stored and processed with a quantum system . 
 a quantum system is always in contact with its surrounding environment , which leads to decoherence in the quantum system . 
 decoherence must be suppressed for quantum information stored in qubits to be intact . 
 there are several proposals to fight against decoherence . 
 quantum error correction , abriviated as qec hereafter , is one of the most promising candidate to suppress environmental noise , which leads to decoherence @xcite . by adding extra ancillary qubits , in analogy with classical error correction , it is possible to encode a data qubit to an @xmath4-qubit codeword in such a way that an error which acted in the error quantum channel is identified by measuring another set of ancillary qubits added for error syndrome readout . 
 then the correct codeword is recovered from a codeword suffering from a possible error by applying a recovery operation , whose explicit form is determined by the error syndrome readout . 
 in contrast with the conventional scheme outlined in the previous paragraph , there is a scheme in which neither syndrome readouts nor syndrome readout ancilla qubits are required @xcite . in particular , in @xcite , a general efficient scheme was proposed . 
 a data qubit is encoded with encoding ancilla qubits by the same encoding circuit as the conventional one , after which a noisy channel is applied on the codeword . 
 subsequently , the inverse of the encoding circuit is applied on a codeword , which possibly suffers from an error . 
 the resulting state is a tensor product of the data qubit state with a possible error and the ancilla qubit state . 
 it is possible to correct erroneous data qubit state by applying correction gates with the ancilla qubits as control qubits and the data qubit as a target qubit . 
 this paper presents two examples of error correcting codes falling in the second category . 
 the noisy quantum channel is assumed to be fully correlated @xcite , which means all the qubits constituting the codeword are subject to the same error operators . in most physical realizations of a quantum computer , 
 the system size is typically on the order of a few micrometers or less , while the environmental noise , such as electromagnetic wave , has a wavelength on the order of a few millimeters or centimeters . 
 then it is natural to assume all the qubits in the register suffer from the same error operator . to demonstrate the advantage of the second category , we restrict ourselves within the noise operators @xmath7 in the following , where @xmath3 is the number of constituent qubits in the codeword . 
 we show that there exists an @xmath4-qubit encoding which accommodates an @xmath5-qubit data state if @xmath4 is odd and an @xmath6-qubit date state if @xmath4 is even . 
 although the channel is somewhat artificial as an error channel , we may apply our error correction scheme in the following situation . 
 suppose alice wants to send qubits to bob . 
 their qubit bases differ by unitary operations @xmath8 or @xmath9 . 
 even when they do not know which basis the other party employs , the can correctly send qubits by adding one extra qubits ( when @xmath4 is odd ) or two extra qubits ( when @xmath4 is even ) .    we state the theorems and prove them in the next section . 
 the last section is devoted to summary and discussions . 
 in the following , @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11th component of the pauli matrices and we take the basis vectors @xmath12 so that @xmath13 is diagonalized . 
 we introduce operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 acting on the @xmath4-qubit space @xmath16 , where @xmath3 as mentioned before . 
 let @xmath17 be @xmath18 complex matrices , and let @xmath19 
 . denote by @xmath20 the ( joint ) rank-@xmath21 numerical range of @xmath22 , which is the collection of @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for some @xmath18 rank-@xmath21 orthogonal projection @xmath25 @xcite . a quantum channel of the form @xmath26 has a @xmath21-dimensional quantum error correcting code ( qecc ) if and only if @xmath27 . 
 to prove this statement , we need to recall the knill - laflamme correctability condition , which asserts that given a quantum channel @xmath28 with error operators @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a qecc of @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the projection operator with the range space @xmath30 @xcite . 
 it should be clear that @xmath34 if and only if there is a qecc with dimension @xmath21 . 
 now it follows from @xmath35 and the relations @xmath36 when @xmath4 is even and @xmath37 when @xmath4 is odd that the channel ( [ eq : corrch ] ) has a @xmath21-dimensional qecc if and only if @xmath38 by noting that @xmath39 irrespective of rank  @xmath25 , we find @xmath40 if and only if @xmath41 . 
 [ thm1 ] suppose @xmath3 is odd 
 . then @xmath42 . 
 our proof is constructive . 
 for @xmath43 , denote @xmath44 . 
 let @xmath45 then @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of @xmath48-combinations from @xmath4 elements . 
 since @xmath49 we have @xmath50 let @xmath25 be the orthogonal projection onto @xmath30 . 
 then the above observation shows that @xmath51 and @xmath52 . 
 therefore , @xmath53 , which shows that @xmath54 and hence @xmath30 is shown to be a @xmath55-dimensional qecc . 
 _    now let us turn to the even @xmath4 case . 
 we first state a lemma which is necessary to prove the theorem . 
 [ lem1 ] let @xmath56 be a normal matrix . 
 then the rank-@xmath21 numerical range of @xmath57 is the intersection of the convex hulls of any @xmath58 eigenvalues of @xmath57 . 
 the proof of the lemma is found in @xcite . 
 [ thm2 ] suppose @xmath3 is even . then @xmath59 but @xmath60 .    _ proof 
 let @xmath61 . by theorem [ thm1 ] , @xmath62 . 
 consider @xmath63 observe that the projection @xmath25 onto @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 and @xmath52 and hence @xmath66 , which proves @xmath59 . 
 _    since @xmath67 is a commuting family , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be diagonalized simultaneously . 
 we may assume that @xmath68 since @xmath69 , we have @xmath70    let us show that @xmath71 . 
 we first note the identity @xmath72 for hermitian @xmath73 . 
 let us replace @xmath74 by @xmath75 and @xmath76 by @xmath77 to obtain @xmath78 . 
 since @xmath75 and @xmath77 commute , @xmath79 is normal and lemma [ lem1 ] is applicable . from eqs . 
 ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , we find @xmath79 has eigenvalues @xmath80 and each eigenvalue is @xmath81-fold degenerate . by taking @xmath82 and @xmath83 in lemma [ lem1 ] , we find the rank-@xmath55 numerical range of @xmath79 is the intersection of the convex hulls of any @xmath84 eigenvalues . 
 since each eigenvalue has multiplicity @xmath81 , each convex hull involves at least three eigenvalues . by inspecting four eigenvalues plotted in the complex plane 
 , we easily find the intersection of all the convex hulls is a single point @xmath85 , which proves @xmath71 . 
 similarly , we prove @xmath86 . from these equalities 
 we obtain @xmath87 suppose @xmath42 . 
 let @xmath25 be a rank-@xmath55 projection such that @xmath88 . 
 let @xmath89\ ] ] where each @xmath90 has size @xmath91 . from @xmath92 and @xmath93 
 , we have four independent equations @xmath94 let @xmath95 be the singular value decomposition of @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a nonnegative diagonal matrix and @xmath98 . then the above equations are solved as @xmath99 by collecting these results , we find the projection operator is decomposed as @xmath100   \[\begin{array}{cc}d&d\\   d&d\end{array}\]\[\begin{array}{cc}u^\dagger&0\\ 0&v^\dagger\end{array}\]\,.\ ] ] since rank  @xmath101 and @xmath102 , it follows from @xmath103 that @xmath104 . 
 let @xmath105 then both @xmath57 and @xmath106 are non - singular . 
 on the other hand , the assumption @xmath107 implies @xmath108 and hence @xmath109 , which is a contradiction . 
 therefore , @xmath60 .    in the following , 
 we give an explicit construction of qecc for @xmath31 in eq . 
 ( [ eq : corrch ] ) with odd @xmath4 . 
 the technique is based on theorem [ thm1 ] and the results in @xcite . 
 let @xmath110 be the @xmath111 matrix with columns in the set @xmath112    define the @xmath113 matrix @xmath114 $ ] . in our qec , an @xmath5-qubit state @xmath115 is encoded with one ancilla qubit @xmath116 as @xmath117 . 
 then a noisy quantum channel @xmath31 is applied on the encoded state and subsequently the recovery operation @xmath118 is applied so that the decoded state automatically appears in the output with no syndrome measurements . 
 our qec is concisely summarized as @xmath119 where @xmath120 . 
 choosing an encoding amounts to assigning each of @xmath81 column vectors in @xmath110 a basis vector of the whole hilbert space without repetition . 
 therefore there are large degrees of freedom in the choice of encoding . in the following examples , 
 we have chosen encoding whose quantum circuit can be implemented with the least number of cnot gates . since our decoding circuit is the inverse of the encoding circuit , it is also implemented with the least number of cnot gates .    when @xmath121 , the unitary operation @xmath122 can be chosen as @xmath123 when @xmath124 , @xmath122 can be chosen as @xmath125    figure [ nodd ] shows quantum circuits of the matrix @xmath122 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 . 
 [ nodd ]    -qubit state @xmath115 with a single ancilla qubit initially in the state @xmath128 . 
 ( a ) is for @xmath126 while ( b ) is for @xmath127 . 
 the quantum channel in the box represents a quantum operation with fully correlated noise given in eq . 
 the output ancilla state is @xmath129 for error operators @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) for @xmath126 and @xmath129 for @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) for @xmath127.,width=529 ]    it follows from eq . 
 ( [ qecc ] ) that the recovery circuit is the inverse of the encoding circuit . 
 it seems , at first sight , that the implementations given in fig . 
 1 contradict with eq . 
 ( [ qecc ] ) since the controlled not gate in the end of the recovery circuit is missing in the encoding circuit . 
 note , however , that the top qubit is set to @xmath138 initially and the controlled not gate is safely omitted without affecting encoding . 
 we construct a decoherence - free encoding when @xmath4 is even as follows . 
 the codeword in this case is immune to the noise operators , which is an analogue of noiseless subspace / subsystem introduced in @xcite . 
 let @xmath139 then evidently a vector @xmath140 is separately invariant under the action of @xmath141 and @xmath9 . 
 there are @xmath142 orthogonal vectors of such form , e.g. we have four vectors , @xmath143 for @xmath144 . 
 thus we find a decoherence - free encoding for @xmath145 qubits by projecting onto this invariant subspace spanned by these basis . 
 it should be noted that the projection operator @xmath25 to the subspace @xmath146 spanned by the four vectors in eq . 
 ( [ nss ] ) satisfies rank  @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which shows @xmath149 . 
 it is easy to generalize this result to cases with arbitrary @xmath150 . 
 figure [ neven ] ( a ) and 
 ( b ) depict quantum circuits for ( a ) @xmath144 and ( b ) @xmath151 , respectively . 
 [ neven ]    -qubit state @xmath115 with two ancilla qubit initially in the state @xmath152 . 
 ( a ) is for @xmath144 while ( b ) is for @xmath151 . 
 the quantum channel in the box represents a quantum operation with fully correlated noise given in eq . 
 the output ancilla state is always @xmath153 , irrespective of error operators acted in the channel.,width=529 ] 
 we have shown that there is a quantum error correction which suppresses fully correlated errors of the form @xmath154 , in which @xmath4 qubits are required to encode ( i ) @xmath155 data qubit states when @xmath4 is odd and ( ii ) @xmath156 data qubit states when @xmath4 is even . 
 we have proved these statements by using operator theoretical technique . 
 neither syndrome measurements nor ancilla qubits for syndrome measurement are required in our scheme , which makes physical implementation of our scheme highly practical . 
 examples with @xmath126 and @xmath127 are analyzed in detail and explicit quantum circuits implementing our qec with the least number of cnot gate were obtained . 
 since the error operators are closed under matrix multiplication , errors can be corrected even when they act on the codeword many times . 
 a somewhat similar qec has been reported in @xcite . 
 they analyzed a partially correlated noise , where the error operators acts on a fixed number of the codeword qubits simultaneously . 
 they have shown that the quantum packing bound was violated by taking advantage of degeneracy of the codes . 
 justification of such a noise physically , however , seems to be rather difficult . 
 they have also shown that correlated noise acting on an arbitrary number @xmath4 of qubits can encode @xmath157 data qubits . 
 in contrast , we have analyzed a fully correlated noise , which shows the highest degeneracy , and have shown that @xmath158 data qubits can be encoded with an @xmath4-qubit codeword when @xmath4 is odd . 
 clearly , our qec suppressing fully correlated errors is optimal as it is clear that one can not encode @xmath4 qubits as data qubits for odd @xmath4 and we have shown that one can not encode @xmath155 qubits for even @xmath4 .

Sample 6:
Input: there are reasons to believe that cosmic rays ( crs ) around the ankle at @xmath0 gev are dominated by extragalactic protons  @xcite . 
 scattering processes in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) limit the propagation of ultra high energy ( uhe ) charged particles in our universe . 
 a continuation of a power - like cr spectrum above the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite at about @xmath1 gev is only consistent with the proton dominance if the sources lie within the proton attenuation length of about 50 mpc . 
 very few astrophysical accelerators can generate crs with energies above the gzk cutoff  ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) and so far none of the candidate sources have been confirmed in our local environment . 
 it has been speculated that decaying superheavy particles , possibly some new form of dark matter or remnants of topological defects , could be a source of uhe crs , but also these proposals are not fully consistent with the cr spectrum at lower energies  @xcite . 
 the observation of gzk excesses has led to speculations about a different origin of uhe crs . 
 berezinsky and zatsepin  @xcite proposed that _ 
 cosmogenic _ neutrinos produced in the decay of the gzk photopions could explain these events assuming a strong neutrino nucleon interaction . 
 we have followed this idea in ref . 
 @xcite and investigated the statistical goodness of scenarios with strongly interacting neutrinos from optically thin sources using cr data from agasa  @xcite and hires  @xcite ( see fig .  [ cr ] ) and limits from horizontal events at agasa  @xcite and contained events at rice  @xcite . 
 -branes , and string excitations ( see ref . 
 @xcite ) . ] 
 the flux of uhe extragalactic protons from distant sources is redshifted and also subject to @xmath2 pair production and photopion - production in the cmb which can be taken into account by means of propagation functions . 
 the resonantly produced photopions provide a _ guaranteed _ source of cosmogenic uhe neutrinos observed at earth . in astrophysical accelerators inelastic scattering of the beam protons off the ambient photon gas in the source will also produce photopions which provide an additional source of uhe neutrinos . the corresponding spectrum will in general depend on the details of the source such as the densities of the target photons and the ambient gas  @xcite . 
 we have used the flux of crs from _ optically thin _ sources using the luminosities given in ref . 
 @xcite in the goodness - of - fit test .    for a reasonable and consistent contribution of extragalactic neutrinos in vertical crs 
 one has to assume a strong and rapid enhancement of the neutrino nucleon interaction . 
 the realization of such a behavior has been proposed in scenarios beyond the ( perturbative ) sm ( see ref . 
 @xcite ) . for convenience 
 , we have approximated the strong neutrino nucleon cross section in our analysis by a @xmath3-behavior shown in fig . 
 [ fig ] , parameterized by the energy scale and width of the transition , and the amplification compared to the standard model predictions . 
 our analysis showed that uhe crs measured at agasa and hires can be interpreted to the 90% cl as a composition of extragalactic protons and strongly interacting neutrinos from optically thin sources in agreement with experimental results from horizontal events at agasa and contained events at rice ( see fig . 
 [ fig ] ) . 
 the pierre auger observatory combines the experimental techniques of agasa and hires as a hybrid detector . with a better energy resolution , much higher statistics and also stronger bounds on horizontal showers 
 it will certainly help to clarify our picture of uhe crs in the future .

Sample 7:
Input: in solid - core photonic crystal fibers ( pcf ) the air - silica microstructured cladding ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) gives rise to a variety of novel phenomena  @xcite including large - mode area ( lma ) endlessly - single mode operation @xcite . 
 though pcfs typically have optical properties very different from that of standard fibers they of course share some of the overall properties such as the susceptibility of the attenuation to macro - bending . 
 macrobending - induced attenuation in pcfs has been addressed both experimentally as well as theoretically / numerically in a number of papers @xcite . however , predicting bending - loss is no simple task and typically involves a full numerical solution of maxwell s equations as well as use of a phenomenological free parameter , _ 
 e.g. _ an effective core radius . in this paper 
 we revisit the problem and show how macro - bending loss measurements on high - quality pcfs can be predicted with high accuracy using easy - to - evaluate empirical relations . 
 predictions of macro - bending induced attenuation in photonic crystal fibers have been made using various approaches including antenna - theory for bent standard fibers @xcite , coupling - length criteria @xcite , and phenomenological models within the tilted - index representation @xcite . here 
 , we also apply the antenna - theory of sakai and kimura  @xcite , but contrary to refs . 
 @xcite we make a full transformation of standard - fiber parameters such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 @xcite to fiber parameters appropriate to high - index contrast pcfs with a triangular arrangement of air holes . in the large - mode area 
 limit we get ( see appendix )    @xmath3    for the power - decay , @xmath4 , along the fiber . for a conversion to a db - scale @xmath5 should be multiplied by @xmath6 . in eq . 
 ( [ alpha_lma ] ) , @xmath7 is the bending radius , @xmath8 is the effective area @xcite , @xmath9 is the index of silica , and @xmath10 is the recently introduced effective v - parameter of a pcf  @xcite . 
 the strength of our formulation is that it contains no free parameters ( such as an arbitrary core radius ) and furthermore empirical expressions , depending only on @xmath11 and @xmath12 , have been given recently for both @xmath8 and @xmath13 @xcite .    from the function 
 @xmath14 we may derive the parametric dependence of the critical bending radius @xmath15 . 
 the function increases dramatically when the argument is less than unity and thus we may define a critical bending radius from @xmath16 where @xmath17 . typically the pcf is operated close to cut - off where @xmath18  @xcite so that the argument may be written as    @xmath19    this dependence was first reported and experimentally confirmed by birks 
 _ et al . _ 
 @xcite and recently a pre - factor of order unity was also found experimentally in ref . 
 we have fabricated three lma fibers by the stack - and - pull method and characterized them using the conventional cut - back technique . 
 all three fibers have a triangular air - hole array and a solid core formed by a single missing air - hole in the center of the structure , see fig . 
 [ fig1 ] .    for the lma-20 macro - bending loss has been measured for bending radii of r=8 cm and r=16 cm and 
 the results are shown in fig . 
 the predictions of eq . 
 ( [ alpha_lma ] ) are also included . 
 it is emphasized that the predictions are based on the empirical relations for @xmath8 and @xmath13 provided in refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively and therefore do not require any numerical calculations . 
 similar results are shown in figs . 
 [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] for the lma-25 and lma-35 fibers , respectively . 
 the pcf , in theory , exhibits both a short and long - wavelength bend - edge . 
 however , the results presented here only indicate a short - wavelength bend - edge . 
 the reason for this is that the long - wavelength bend - edge occurs for @xmath20 @xcite . for typical lma - pcfs 
 it is therefor located in the non - transparent wavelength regime of silica . 
 in conclusion we have demonstrated that macro - bending loss measurements on high - quality pcfs can be predicted with good accuracy using easy - to - evaluate empirical relations with only @xmath21 and @xmath22 as input parameters . 
 since macro - bending attenuation for many purposes and applications is the limiting factor we believe that the present results will be useful in practical designs of optical systems employing photonic crystal fibers . 
 the starting point is the bending - loss formula for a gaussian mode in a standard - fiber @xcite    @xmath23    where @xmath8 is the effective area , @xmath24 is the core radius , @xmath7 is the bending radius , and the standard - fiber parameters are given by @xcite @xmath25 substituting these parameters into eq . 
 ( [ alpha1 ] ) we get    @xmath26    in the relevant limit where @xmath27 . here , 
 @xmath28 and @xmath29 in eqs .  ( [ alpha_lma ] ) and ( [ v_pcf ] ) have been introduced . for large - mode area fibers we make a further simplification for the isolated propagation constant ; using that @xmath30 we arrive at eq .

Sample 8:
Input: a fair number of astronomers and astronomy students have a physical challenge . 
 it is our responsibility to learn the basics of accessibility to be able to help our library patrons to gain access to things that they need for their studies and work . 
 astronomy is often seen as a very visual science . 
 after all , its origins lie in looking at the skies . 
 hence , it is a common belief that you need to use your sight to be able to study astronomy . 
 this is strictly not true . in reality 
 , we have been using assistive technologies  telescopes , sensors , computers  for a long time now to gain access to data that the human eye does not see unaided . 
 visual information is coming to us as large streams of bytes . 
 the modern astronomer is hardly bound by physical limitations . 
 one can produce solid research sitting comfortably in front of one s personal computer . 
 there are many examples of physically challenged individuals who have made successful careers in science . 
 those who have seen the movie _ contact _ based on carl sagan s novel are familiar with the blind astronomer who is listening to radio signals instead of watching them on the screen . 
 his character is based on a real scientist , dr . d. kent cullers . 
 there are other success stories  in fact , too many to enumerate here . 
 but , you ask , is nt the sheer amount of information a major hindrance to those who can not browse it easily ? yes , it is  to some degree . 
 electronic textual materials provide both a possibility and a challenge for those with low vision . in theory , it is possible for almost anyone to access online information , but in practice , this requires know - how and proper tools . 
 plenty of assistive technologies exist to overcome hindrances . 
 the daisy standard for digital talking books has been an important tool for making electronic texts easy to browse . 
 not all hindrances are in the visual domain . 
 imagine an elderly astronomer who has the full use of his or her intelligence , but whose hands are shaking , and who might have some difficulty with pointing a mouse when navigating a webpage and filling out search forms .    it is a challenging task for librarians and information specialists to make our services and search forms accessible to people with a diversity of abilities so that they can do the research necessary for building careers as active contributors in their chosen fields of research . 
 but what does accessibility look like ? 
 there is a pervasive myth that it looks boring . 
 this is strictly not true . 
 accessible design should be functional enough , not just pretty . with proper html code and other techniques , we can make the text compliant with technological aids . 
 if the html coding is poor , a document may be impossible to open with such aids or it could be impossible to navigate the text . 
 the author of this paper was involved with an university - wide accessibility project that was undertaken by the university of helsinki in 20052006 , with a follow up in 20082009 . 
 it was recognized that accessibility must cover not only our physical surroundings , but also the online environment as well .    in spring 2009 
 , we noticed that the new national online system for applying for university education was not accessible to blind students . 
 the system was provided by the finnish ministry of education , and we challenged them to fix it . to our big surprise , they did , working in collaboration with us and the finnish federation of the visually impaired . 
 figure 1 shows a page from the application system . 
 it looks exactly the same both before and after accessibility changes were made . 
 differences can be seen on the coding level , but otherwise one can not tell the old version from the new one by visual inspection alone . the change has resulted in a major functional improvement . the old version could not even be opened with assistive technology , and blind students could not use it . now they can . 
 accessibility needs some muscle to drive it . 
 it is not just about good people doing good deeds  it is also about ensuring that everyone has access to things that matter to them . 
 we need guidelines and standards , preferably with legislation to back them up .    in the united states , section 508 of the rehabilitation act 
 regulates purchases made with federal funding . 
 it is about `` access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to others . '' 
 a market for accessible products helps big publishers to take accessibility into account . when a publisher has a large enough number of customers who need to buy accessible products , they will be motivated to sell accessible products . 
 we also need strong standards . the world wide consortium has updated its web content accessibility guidelines ( wcag )  version 2 dates back to 2008 . 
 this new version of wcag is meant to be a practical tool , evidenced by its three levels of accessibility :    * a : minimum * aa : medium * aaa : as accessible as possible    you will find a good wcag2 checklist online . 
 the ideal thing to do would be to make your website as accessible as possible , but in practice you need to read the guidelines and identify the accessibility level best suited to serving your users . 
 let s look at a concrete example by applying an a - level guideline to an existing search form . 
 the guideline states : `` form inputs have associated text labels or , if labels can not be used , a descriptive title attribute . '' 
 let s look at a part of an ads search form with its original coding . 
 this piece of code is from the section which requires an object for selection .    0.2 in    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ` 
 < input name = obj_req value = yes type = checkbox > require object for selection ` _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    0.2 in    let s add some more coding ( in boldface ) . rather than just a checkbox , we now have a _ text label_.    0.2 in    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ` < input id = obj_req name = obj_req value = yes type = checkbox > < label for = obj_req > require object for selection</label > ` _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    0.2 in    figure 2 shows what has changed . the text label in question has been highlighted . 
 it is no longer necessary to hit the small checkbox 
 it is enough if you just click the associated text . 
 this makes the box much easier to check . 
 you can do clever things with html . 
 there are however many other formats to consider : pdf , flash , and office products , to name just a few . 
 no matter what the material at hand , it needs structure above all else . otherwise , a blind person who tries to read a text has to read everything from beginning to end and is not able to navigate to a chapter or a footnote . 
 even pdf which used to be an accessibility nightmare can now boast of a structure to make it more accessible 
 it s called tagged pdf .    as a general guideline , 
 no matter what kind of document you are writing , you will need to stick to structure . 
 do you use subtitles that are bold and in a different font ? 
 please , use proper titles instead and use styles to control the fonts and such . 
 let s take a peek at an html page that has structure . 
 there are tools to make the structure visible . 
 the box in figure 3 has been done with a wave toolbar . 
 this example is taken from _ 
 planetary and space science_. a good amount of structure has been revealed . 
 the html structure of _ earth , moon and planets _ , shows next to nothing . 
 its only structure is a references header , `` h2 references . '' 
 there is no subtitle structure at all that you can jump to . 
 most publishers make their electronic materials available in pdf format . 
 usually , those files are without any structure . 
 figure 4 shows the acrobat reader results of an accessibility quick check  there is no structure . 
 what is the current situation with different astronomy publishers and journals ? 
 table 1 shows accessibility elements for a selection of publishers based on inspection of a few papers published in 2009 by university of helsinki astronomers . 
 we asked some questions about the basic properties of each paper . 
 is there html fulltext ? 
 does it have structure ? and does the pdf have structure ? if not , are there at least pdf bookmarks ? 
 you can see that these results leave a lot to hope for . 
 the only consistently good results are from _ planetary and space science _ , which is published by elsevier . 
 unfortunately , however , not all elsevier products are equally accessible . 
 llcccc title & publisher & html & html & pdf & + & & fulltext & structure & structure & bookmarks + astronomy & astrophysics & edp sciences & yes & ok & no & yes + astrophysical journal & iop & yes & none & no & yes + monthly notices r.a.s . & wiley & yes & none & no & no + astron . 
 nachrichten & wiley & no &  & no & no + planetary space sci . & 
 elsevier & yes & ok & yes & yes + earth , moon & planets & springer & yes & none & no & yes +    elsevier was the winner of this brief check . 
 it has been making some efforts to increase accessibility of its products , which sets a good example for other big publishers . 
 @xcite have inspected the overall accessibility compliance and practices of major database vendors , elsevier included .    even if major publishers are making some progress , it is not enough . 
 there are also smaller publishers , and beyond that there are institutes and libraries producing their own online materials or making their own search forms . 
 many of them are unaware of current accessibility standards . 
 standards can seem difficult to apply . 
 but really , they are easy to follow if we make the guidelines clear enough so that everyone can understand and use them . 
 remember that new technologies are taken into use all the time . 
 we will be constantly facing new challenges to make them accessible , but they will also bring new possibilities with them . 
 there is one last thing that you need to be aware of  do nt forget about copyright . 
 it is not a given fact that a library can freely distribute electronic material to a patron who could then read it on a personal computer or some other device . 
 the copyright laws in different countries vary surprisingly on this point . moreover , 
 even when the right to access is written into a law , thus making special exceptions to copyright for disabled persons , a license agreement between a library and a publisher might take this right away for particular electronic materials or products . a publisher or 
 a consortium will not allow you to do things that are not specifically stated in the signed agreement . 
 please always remember to check the accessibility options in agreements you sign .    to give an example , 
 the current finnish national electronic library ( finelib ) consortium agreement with elsevier specifies that `` coursepacks in nonelectronic , non - print perceptible form ( e.g. braille ) may be offered for [ the ] visually impaired . '' 
 this is not , however , how visually impaired users would like to use the materials . 
 this is a standard clause that should be modified to meet real needs . 
 unfortunately , when the consortium was formed , this clause did not receive the proper attention it should have . 
 practically everyone who lives long enough has to face physical challenges at some point . 
 an astronomer who is able - bodied today could have accessibility issues tomorrow . 
 we can not expect that she or he is willing to give up practicing science . in her essay _ the blind astronomer _ 
 @xcite , the new zealand astronomer tracy farr eloquently describes the changes brought by the gradual loss of her vision . with a different approach to looking at the research data 
 , she can continue to access the universe :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i am freeing myself from the fixedness of the seen . with my mind

Sample 9:
Input: the transformation , upon charge doping , of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulator into a superconducting ( sc ) metal and the role of af correlations in the appearance of superconductivity have challenged researchers since the discovery of high-@xmath12 superconductivity in cuprates . 
 is the af order an indispensable component or a competitor for the high-@xmath12 phenomenon ? in a prototype high-@xmath12 cuprate la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 , 
 the long - range af order is destroyed by doped holes way before the superconductivity sets in @xcite , which has led to a general belief that the spin frustration is a prerequisite for metallic conduction and superconductivity . 
 the destructive impact of static spin order on superconductivity was further supported by the observation of sc suppression at a peculiar 1/8 doping in la@xmath6ba@xmath7cuo@xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand , spin excitations 
 are often suggested to provide glue for sc pairing , implying the ultimate importance of af correlations , be they static or dynamic . besides , the incompatibility of static af order and sc may be not necessarily a general feature of cuprates . in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 
 ( @xmath1 is a rare - earth element ) , for instance , the long - range af order survives up to much higher doping levels than in la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 @xcite , though the possibility of its coexistence with superconductivity still remains to be clarified .    in strongly anisotropic high-@xmath12 cuprates 
 , the @xmath0-axis charge transport appears to be remarkably sensitive to the spin ordering in cuo@xmath2 planes . in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals , for example , the @xmath0-axis resistivity @xmath13 exhibits a steep increase at the nel temperature @xmath14 @xcite . 
 even relatively weak modifications of the spin structure such as spin - flop or metamagnetic transitions result in surprisingly large changes  by up to an order of magnitude  in the @xmath0-axis resistivity of both hole - doped la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 @xcite and electron - doped pr@xmath15la@xmath16ce@xmath17cuo@xmath8 @xcite and nd@xmath6ce@xmath17cuo@xmath8 crystals @xcite . 
 this sensitivity of the interplane charge transport in cuprates to the spin order can be , and actually is , employed for tracing the evolution of the spin state with doping , temperature , or magnetic fields @xcite . 
 while electrical resistivity measurements have proved to be a very convenient tool for mapping the magnetic phase diagrams in cuprates , their usage has an obvious limitation ; namely , they fail as the superconductivity sets in . 
 because of this limitation , previous resistivity studies of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals @xcite could not clarify whether the long - range af order vanishes by the onset of superconductivity , or extends further , intervening the sc region . 
 it sounds tempting to employ strong magnetic fields to suppress the superconductivity and to use the @xmath0-axis resistivity technique of detecting the spin order in otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase diagram . in the present paper , 
 we use this approach to study the very region of the af - sc transformation in luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 and yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystals . 
 @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystals with nonmagnetic rare - earth elements @xmath1@xmath5lu and y were grown by the flux method and their oxygen stoichiometry was tuned to the required level by high - temperature annealing with subsequent quenching @xcite . in order to ensure that no oxygen - enriched layer was formed at the crystal surface during the quenching process , 
 one of the crystals was dissolved in acid in several steps ; resistivity measurements detected no considerable change in the sc transition upon the crystal s surface destruction . 
 the @xmath0-axis resistivity @xmath13 was measured using the ac four - probe technique . to provide a homogeneous current flow along the @xmath0-axis 
 , two current contacts were painted to almost completely cover the opposing @xmath18-faces of the crystal , while two voltage contacts were placed in small windows reserved in the current ones @xcite . 
 the magnetoresistance ( mr ) was measured by sweeping temperature at fixed magnetic fields up to 16.5 t applied along the @xmath0 axis of the crystals . 
 a representative @xmath13 curve obtained for a luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal with a doping level slightly lower than required for the onset of superconductivity is shown in fig .  1 . 
 in general , the @xmath0-axis resistivity in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals of non - sc composition exhibits two peculiar features upon cooling below room temperature , both of which can be seen in fig .  1 . 
 the first one is a pronounced crossover at @xmath19 ( @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22k for the particular composition in fig .  1 ) , indicating a change  with decreasing temperature  of the dominating conductivity mechanism from some kind of thermally activated hopping to a coherent transport @xcite . 
 it is worth noting that a similar coherent - incoherent crossover was observed in other layered oxides as well @xcite . 
 the second feature is a sharp growth of the resistivity associated with the long - range af ordering @xcite . 
 if the crystals were less homogeneous , the low - temperature resistivity upturn would be easy to confuse with a usual disorder - induced charge localization . however , this sharp resistivity anomaly with a characteristic negative peak in the derivative ( inset in fig . 
 1 ) is definitely related to the spin ordering at the nel temperature @xmath14 : it has been traced from the parent compositions @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath23 with well - known @xmath14 to avoid any doubt in its origin .    , of a luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath24 single crystal . 
 the sharp growth of the resistivity upon cooling below @xmath25@xmath26k is caused by the af ordering . 
 inset : anomaly in the normalized derivative @xmath27 associated with the nel transition.,width=287 ]    in carefully prepared crystals , the af transitions remain sharp for all compositions , including crystals with very low @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30k , that is @xmath3120 times lower than original @xmath32@xmath25@xmath33k in parent @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath23 . 
 it is important to emphasize that the transitions at @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30k remain virtually as sharp as in undoped parent crystals even though spin freezing into a spin - glass state is usually expected for such low temperatures and high hole concentrations @xcite . 
 moreover , the impact of the af ordering on @xmath13 does not weaken with decreasing nel temperature ; as can be seen in fig .  1 , the resistivity of the crystal with @xmath28@xmath29@xmath34k increases by more than 50% upon cooling below @xmath14 , while in crystals with @xmath28@xmath35@xmath36k the corresponding @xmath37 growth does not exceed 15 - 20% @xcite . 
 what do these observations tell about the impact of doped holes on copper spins ? apparently , the sharp af transitions are hard to reconcile with strongly frustrated spin states and disordered spin textures in cuo@xmath2 planes that are usually expected to emerge in cuprates with doping @xcite . 
 besides , a strong frustration - induced reduction of the staggered magnetization @xmath38 required to account for the decrease in @xmath14 would necessarily diminish the impact of the interplane spin ordering on @xmath37 , which again disagrees with observations . on the other hand , if the role of mobile doped holes is not to introduce a uniform spin frustration , but simply to break the long - range af order into two - dimensional domains in cuo@xmath2 planes , the observed behavior is easier to understand . in this case , it is the af domains in cuo@xmath2 planes that become the elementary magnetic units and the long - range af state should develop through ordering of their phases , which can occur rather abruptly . correspondingly , the @xmath14 evolution with doping should be governed by the decreasing af domain size , rather than @xmath38 . in turn , the ordering of af domains whose local staggered magnetization does nor change appreciably with hole doping leaves room for large changes in the @xmath0-axis resistivity even at low @xmath14 .    the @xmath14 and @xmath12 values determined from the @xmath0-axis resistivity of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals have been used to establish the doping - temperature phase diagram in fig .  2 . 
 a peculiarity of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals is that their doping level is determined both by the oxygen content and by the degree of its ordering @xcite . for characterizing the doping level , 
 we use therefore the in - plane conductivity @xmath39 instead of the oxygen content ; the former is a good measure of the hole density given that the hole mobility stays almost constant in the doping region under discussion @xcite . 
 ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath1 = lu , tm , y ) crystals near the af - sc transformation . the af and sc transition temperatures , @xmath14 and @xmath12 , are presented as a function of the in - plane conductivity @xmath39 which is a good measure of the hole density in the shown doping region @xcite . 
 the nel temperature was determined either at the position of the jump ( middle point ) in the derivative @xmath40 ( open circles ) , or at the position of the negative peak in @xmath40 ( solid circles).,width=326 ]    as can be seen in fig .  2 
 , the long - range af order in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 appears to be much more stable than in la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 where it vanishes well in advance before the onset of superconductivity . in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 , 
 the af phase boundary flattens upon approaching the sc compositions and hits the sc region , crossing the @xmath12 line at @xmath25@xmath41k . 
 the observed overlap of the sc and af regions is very close to the area where @xmath42sr studies of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ceramics revealed the coexistence of superconductivity with spontaneous static magnetism @xcite . given that the @xmath0-axis resistivity studied here is sensitive to the _ interlayer _ spin ordering , the static magnetism detected by @xmath42sr @xcite should in fact be related to the three - dimensional af order . 
 the superconductivity in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 thus develops directly from the af - ordered state without any intervening paramagnetic or spin - glass region . 
 cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal for two oxygen concentrations near the af - sc transformation . for the superconducting composition @xmath43 , 
 the data were taken at several magnetic fields  from zero up to 16.5 t  applied along the @xmath0 axis . 
 the sharp upturn in the resistivity associated with the nel transition shows up as the superconductivity is suppressed with the magnetic field.,width=326 ]    according to the established phase diagram ( fig . 
 2 ) , an increase of the hole density in cuo@xmath2 planes by @xmath441% per cu ( from @xmath215% to @xmath256% , assuming the onset of superconductivity at @xmath255% doping ) turns an af @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystal without any sign of superconductivity into a bulk superconductor with @xmath9@xmath44@xmath45k . what happens with the af order upon entering the sc region , does it vanish abruptly ? 
 zero - field @xmath13 curves measured on the same luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystal for two hole doping levels ( that differ by @xmath250.5 - 0.6% per cu ) indeed demonstrate a switch from an af state with @xmath13 sharply growing below @xmath14 to a sc state ( fig . 
 however , when the superconductivity is suppressed with the magnetic field @xmath46@xmath47@xmath48 , the steep increase in @xmath37 associated with the af ordering is recovered back ( fig .  3 ) . moreover , the recovered nel temperature is merely several kelvin lower than for the non - sc composition ( upper curve in fig .  3 ) and 
 the resistivity increase is not reduced appreciably either . as long as the sc in luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 and yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals is weak enough to be killed by the 16.5-t field , 
 the unveiled @xmath13 curves keep demonstrating the anomalous growth below 15 - 20@xmath49k associated with the nel transition . 
 this behavior indicates that , at least when superconductivity is suppressed with magnetic fields , the af order extends to considerably higher doping levels than the sc onset . 
 consequently , at zero magnetic field the af and sc orders either coexist with each other in a certain range of doping , or the af order is frustrated in the sc state but revives as the superconductivity is destroyed with the magnetic field . 
 a switching between the af and sc orders was indeed suggested based on early @xmath42sr studies @xcite , yet no further proofs were collected . 
 the close location and even overlapping of the af and sc orders on the phase diagram raise another question of whether the af and sc orders reside in nanoscopically separated phases in cuo@xmath2 planes or coexist on the unit - cell scale , which calls for local microscopic tools to be clarified .

Sample 10:
Input: the variability of ex lup was discovered by miss e. janssen in 1944 while examining spectral plates at the harvard observatory ( mclaughlin 1946 ) . 
 herbig ( 1950 ) first pointed out the similarity of ex lupi s spectral characteristics and t tauri stars with strong emission lines of h , caii , feii , and hei . in one of the spectrograms he obtained in 1949/1950 
 the h and caii lines clearly show an inverse p cygni profile . 
 herbig ( 1977a ) assigned the spectral type of m0:ev using the 5850 - 6700  range . 
 photographic and visual light - curves covering a century of observations revealed the irregular photometric behaviour of the star ( mclaughlin 1946 , bateson et al . 
 outbursts of up to 5 magnitudes may occur , but the star normally shows only small amplitude irregular variations . 
 the most prominent events last about one year . 
 the typical recurrence time scale of outbursts is of the order of a decade . 
 + up to now there are only a few other stars known with comparable outburst characteristics ( herbig 1989 ) . 
 this small group of very active t tauri stars has been called exors or sometimes sub - fuors . both names point to an affinity to the so called fu orionis stars ( fuors ) . 
 fuors are another group of young low mass stars with even stronger outbursts lasting for decades . unlike exors , during an outburst fuor spectra turn from t tauri characteristics to that of much earlier 
 f or g supergiants lacking strong line emission ( herbig 1977b ) . 
 fuors have high mass accretion rates ( @xmath0,hartmann 1991 ) and strong winds ( e.g. calvet et al . 1993 ) and they may be the source that drive herbig - haro flows ( reipurth 1989 ) . 
 + exors are little studied , but potentially of great interest because they may represent an intermediate level of activity between ordinary active t tauri stars and full blown fu orionis eruptions . in order to cast further light on this interpretation 
 , we have followed some exors spectroscopically and photometrically during 1993 and 1994 . 
 the star ex lup has been at a low level of activity during the 1980 s . in the early 1990 s this situation changed and the star became active ( jones et al . 
 1993 , hughes et al . 
 amateur observations ( variable star section of the royal astronomical society of new zealand , unpublished ) indicated a strong brightening in february / march 1994 . 
 patten ( 1994 ) reports some follow - up photometric and low resolution spectroscopic observations of the same outburst . 
 + in this paper we present part of our optical observations of ex lup taken at eso , la silla . 
 we concentrate on data obtained during the outburst in march 1994 and include some spectroscopic observations carried out in august 1994 when the star only exhibited post - outburst low level activity . 
 a complete presentation of our data will appear in a future paper . 
 differential ccd photometry has been carried out at the 0.9m - dutch and the 1.54m - danish telescopes . 
 this photometry was later calibrated with respect to standard stars including extinction and colour corrections . 
 all reductions have been made with the apphot package in iraf . 
 typical errors ( 1@xmath1 ) in the differential photometry are @xmath2b=0.005 , @xmath2v=0.004 , @xmath2r=0.004 whereas the absolute magnitude scale itself is accurate to about 0.01 in all three colours . 
 + the resulting lightcurves in b , v , and r are presented in fig . 
 1 . the maximum occurred between february 25 and march 4 ( herbig , priv . 
 the fading tail of the eruption can be described as an exponential decline with small fluctuations superimposed . 
 variability of more than 0.1mag is present on timescales of less than one hour ( e.g. march 6.3 , see also patten 1994 ) . 
 figure 2 displays the colour change in b - v during the decline . 
 the star clearly becomes redder when fading . 
 for comparison we have included some points close to minimum light taken from the literature . 
 the outburst amplitude was about @xmath2v=2.0mag and @xmath2b=2.6mag  . 
 spectroscopic observations in the blue spectral range were carried out during the first few nights in march 1994 on the eso-1.52 m telescope using the boller & chivens spectrograph at 1.2 resolution . 
 after the decline of ex lup we obtained post - outburst spectra in the same wavelength region at resolutions of 1.5 and 12 at the 3.5m - ntt with emmi in august 1994 . 
 all spectra have been reduced with the ctioslit package in iraf . 
 observations of spectrophotometric standards and nightly extinction curves allowed for a flux calibration . 
 + in fig.3 we present two spectra of ex lup : one close to the outburst maximum and the other at low activity almost half a year after the eruption . some of the emission lines of h , caii , feii , hei , and heii are indicated . under the assumption that the total light can be decomposed into an underlying t tauri star photosphere , a continuum source , and superimposed emission lines , we now discuss the different spectral components and their variability .      a powerful method to determine 
 the continuum excess emission is to determine the veiling by comparison with spectra of stars of the same spectral type and luminosity class but lacking any disk signature ( hartigan et al . 
 1989 , 1991 ) . 
 the accuracy of the veiling determination decreases rapidly when the emission component exceeds the photospheric luminosity . in the case of ex lup during its eruption we therefore did not intend to derive the veiling and the true excess emission spectrum by comparison with spectral type standards , but we could examine the spectral variability caused by the outburst . + 
 no photospheric absorption features are seen during the outburst ( upper spectrum in fig.3 ) but they appear in the post - outburst spectrum . 
 thus the major source of variability presumably is a featureless continuum . 
 therefore , a difference spectrum between outburst and post - outburst spectra should be a good measure of the continuum emission spectrum . in fig . 
 4 we plot two difference spectra at low resolution . 
 the first shows the difference between an outburst ( march 3 ) and a post - outburst ( august 16 ) spectrum , while the second shows the difference between two post - outburst ( august 18 and 16 ) spectra which displays normal low - level variability . 
 the continuum emission spectrum displaying the normal low - level activity is bluer than the continuum emission present during outburst . 
 the most intriguing features in the spectra of ex lup are strong emission lines . 
 the balmer series can be seen up to h15 especially during times of minimum activity . 
 equivalent widths and fluxes of individual lines are given in table 1 . 
 essentially all strong emission lines have increasing fluxes as the star brightens . 
 however due to the steep rise of the continuum the equivalent widths decrease , which is also evident in the data from patten ( 1994 ) at h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , and h@xmath5 during the maximum . 
 obviously the caii lines have a larger flux amplification during the outburst than the balmer lines . 
 there is some indication that line fluxes of metals do not increase while the star goes into outburst ( cai , feii , srii ) .

 equivalent widths and line fluxes during the outburst measured on march 3 ( @xmath8 ) and in the post - outburst spectrum on august 16 ( @xmath9 ) [ cols= " < " , ]     @xmath11 & -0.4 & -1.7 & 8 & 3 + heii 4686 & -0.3 & -0.9 & 6 & 2 + h@xmath4 4861 & -9.4 & -16.8 & 196 & 30 + feii 4924 &  & -1.5 &  & 2 +    the presence of inverse p cygni profiles in the strongest emission lines during outburst , as first noted by herbig ( 1950 ) , is here corroborated . at 
 balmer lines higher than h9 the equivalent width of the redshifted absorption dip is even larger than the width of the emission component . comparing the sequence of spectra between march 3 and 6 we can see a substantial fading of the absorption . 
 the mean velocity displacement of the absorption measured in these spectra is @xmath12 km / s . 
 this absorption component is still visible in our spectrum taken on august 18 ( fig.5a ) . 
 we also plot the difference between the two spectra from august 18 and august 16 to enhance the visibility of the absorption dip and to remove possible contamination due to photospheric lines . 
 the displacement of the absorption dip measured in the post - outburst difference spectrum corresponds to a velocity of @xmath13 km / s . 
 photospheric features of the underlying t tauri star can be seen only in the post - outburst spectra . 
 figure 6 shows the region around cai 4227 , which is the strongest stellar absorption line , in two post - outburst spectra . 
 the difference of these two spectra no longer exhibits the absorption line , and the change of total flux by about 40% is therefore due to continuum emission rather than photospheric variability . 
 + the photospheric lines of the t tauri star are veiled , even at minimum brightness . 
 the superimposed emission line spectrum additionally fills in many absorption lines . 
 the measurement of the veiling is therefore rather difficult . 
 we find a good fit to the observed strength of absorption lines by introducing a flat continuum emission equal to the photospheric continuum of the underlying star ( veiling r=1 , comparison with hd  202560 , spectral type m0v ) at 4200  when the brightness of ex lup is v=13.0 . 
 the outburst of ex lup can be understood in terms of a mass accretion event causing increased continuum emission in a hot region close to the surface of the star where the infalling matter finally releases its kinetic energy . 
 the total light of the photosphere and the hot region becomes dominated by the latter and therefore it is much bluer during the outburst . 
 furthermore all photospheric lines are heavily veiled ( assuming that r=1 at minimum light then the veiling during outburst would be r@xmath1420 ) . 
 the different slope of the continuum emission in the outburst compared to the post - outburst ( see fig.4 ) indicates that the hot region is _ cooler _ during outburst ( assuming no change in extinction due to circumstellar matter ) . 
 this interpretation then implies a dramatic expansion of the hot region in order to account for the observed rise in luminosity during the outburst . 
 + the inverse p cygni profiles of many emission lines prove the infall motion of accreted material . 
 the velocity derived from the redward displacement of the absorption component of these lines are of the order of 300 km / s and therefore much higher than those assumed in the classical boundary layer model for t tauri stars ( lynden - bell & pringle , 1974 ) . however , these high infall velocities may result from magnetospherically mediated disk accretion ( camenzind 1990 , knigl 1991 , hartmann et al . 
 high resolution studies of classical t tauri stars have revealed a large fraction of stars exhibiting inverse p cygni structures ( e.g. appenzeller 1977 , edwards et al . , 1994 ) . 
 the usual low level variability might be caused by geometrical effects during the rotation of the star . 
 the more dramatic outbursts could be attributed to episodic changes in the magnetosphere , resulting in more extended infall flows of circumstellar material onto the star .
